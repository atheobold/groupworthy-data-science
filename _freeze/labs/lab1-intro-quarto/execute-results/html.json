Save the Quarto file as \"lab1\" in your \"week_1\" or \"labs\" folder. You can change up the name of your document, but the name **cannot** have spaces and it should describe what the document is.\n\n\n## Specifying Global Execute Options\n\nExecution options specify how the R code in your Quarto document should be\ndisplayed. This [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) \nprovides descriptions on the options you can specify in a document's execution.\n\nTo start, your YAML should look something like this:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Lab 1: Introduction to Quarto\"\nauthor: \"Dr. Theobold\"\nformat: html\nself-contained: true\neditor: source\n---\n```\n\nSimilar to how you added an `author`, `embed-resources`, (and `editor`) line, \nyou will first need to add an `execute` line to your YAML.\n\nUse the guide above to specify execution options so that:\n\n1.  your source code is always output on the page.\n2.  your document will render even if there are errors.\n\n## Running the Provided Code\n\nNext, click on the \"Play\" button on the right of the first auto-populated code chunk. Alternatively, you can highlight (or simply put your cursor on the line of) the code you want to run and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n\nYou should see the code appear in the console, as well as the result of the code (`2`). Keep in mind the `[1]` before the `2` is vector notation. This means the result is a *vector* of length 1, whose first element is `2`. \n\nLet's spice this code up a bit. Delete `1 + 1` from the code chunk and write the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load a dataset into the R Environment.\ndata(ToothGrowth)\n\n# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.\nsummary(ToothGrowth)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow run this code. You should see a six-number summary of the variables `len`\nand `dose` included in the `ToothGrowth` dataset, as well as the frequency of\nthe levels contained in the `supp` variable. Further, if you inspect the\nEnvironment tab, the `ToothGrowth` dataset should appear. You can click on the\ndataset name (not the blue play button!) to look at the data.\n\n\n### Check the Data Documentation\n\nIn your **console** (*not* in the Quarto document), type `?ToothGrowth` (or\nalternatively `help(ToothGrowth)`.\n\nUse the information that pops up in the *Help* pane in RStudio to fill in the\nblanks below. Add the questions and your responses *after* the R code chunk.\n*Before* the code chunk, create a section header (using `#`s) that describes the\ncontents of the section (e.g., Tooth Growth Dataset).\n\n*This dataset investigates the effect of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_ on tooth growth in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.*\n\n*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_) and VC (\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_).*\n\n*It is a data frame with \\_\\_\\_\\_ observations and \\_\\_\\_\\_ variables.*\n\n\n## Creating a Plot\n\nYour second code chunk is just as boring as your first, so let's spice it up!\nReplace the `2 * 2` code with the following (we will talk about graphics next\nweek!):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data = ToothGrowth, \n       mapping = aes(x = supp, y = len)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Supplement\", y = \"Length of Teeth (mm)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab1-intro-quarto_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, run this code chunk! You should see side-by-side boxplots comparing tooth\nlength between the two supplement delivery methods contained in the\n`ToothGrowth` data set.\n\nLook back at the help documentation for the `ToothGrowth` dataset to determine\nwhat `len` represents (i.e., \"Length of xxx\").\n\nNext, look up the help file on the `labs()` ggplot2 function to find the\narguments you can use to specify the $x$- and $y$-axis labels. Change the\n$x$-axis and $y$-axis labels to display reader-friendly axis labels as found in\nthe `ToothGrowth` help file. For example, \"Supplement Type\" is better than\n\"supp.\"\n\nNote that `#| echo: false` is an output option applied only to this specific\ncode chunk. Remove this line so the code appears in your final rendered document.\n\nCreate another section header (like you did before) stating what is included in this section.\n\n## Changing Local Code Chunk Options\n\n2. Specify in the code chunk options that your boxplots of tooth length by\nsupplement delivery method should be **center aligned**.\n\n3. Write and include a **figure caption* for the boxplots using a code-chunk option.\n\n\n## Inserting a New Code Chunk\n\nNavigate to the last sentence of the Quarto document. We're now going to insert a new `R` code chunk at the bottom of the document.\n\nThere are four different ways to do this:\n\n1.  type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS,\n\n2.  Click on the ![](images/add-code-chunk.jpg) symbol. This should automatically default to R code, but if you have a Python compiler on your computer, you might need to select \"R\" from the options.\n\n3.  If you are using the Visual editor, click on the \"Insert\" button, then select \"Code Chunk\", and finally select \"R\".\n\n4.  Manually add the code chunk by typing ```` ```{r} ````. Make sure to close your code chunk with ```` ``` ````.\n\n### Conducting a t-test for Two Independent Samples \n\nIn this section, we are going to conduct a two-sample independent t-test to\ncompare tooth length between the two supplement methods in the `ToothGrowth`\ndataset. I have outlined the null and alternative hypotheses we will be testing:\n\n$H_0$: The treatment mean tooth length for the OJ supplement delivery method \n**is the same** as the treatment mean tooth length for the VC supplement\ndelivery method.\n\n$H_A$: The treatment mean tooth length for the OJ supplement delivery method\n**is different** from the treatment mean tooth length for the VC supplement\ndelivery method.\n\nWhile a second course in statistics is a pre-requisite for this class, you may\nwant to go [here](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-two-means) for a\nrefresher on conducting two-sample independent t-tests.\n\nCarry out the following steps:\n\n1. Look up the help documentation for `t.test()`. Hint: look at the examples at\nthe bottom for comparing `extra` across groups in the `sleep` dataset.\n\n2. Using the function `t.test()`, write code to carry out the analysis. You can\nassume unequal variances and a two-sided alternative.\n\n3. Run your code chunk to obtain the output for your statistical test.\n\n4. Create a numbered list containing:\n\n-   Your conclusion (in the context of these data) based on the p-value.\n-   An interpretation of the confidence interval (make sure to read what\nconfidence level is used by default).\n\n5. Create another section header, describing the contents of this section.\n\n## Render Your Document\n\nRender your document as an **html** file. Use the \"Render\" button (the blue\narrow!) at the top of your screen.\n\nIf you run into trouble rendering your document, try restarting R and running\nyour code chunks in order, and see if you can find the problem.\n\nAnother common issue is deleting the tick marks (```` ``` ````) that surround\nyour code chunks. If you notice that the code chunks are not showing a \"Play\"\nbutton, or that they are not highlighted in gray, double check your tick marks!\n\nRecall we included `error: true` in our YAML execution options. This means that\nyour document will still render even if there are errors. Make sure you are\ndouble checking your work!\n\nYou will notice that there is auto-generated text that is unrelated to the work\nthat you completed. It is always a good idea to delete this extra text!\n\n## Challenge 1: Styling your Quarto Document\n\nYou can find a list of every option you can use to format an HTML document\n[here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and\n[here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html). Further,\n[here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) are lists of\ndifferent themes you can specify in your YAML to produce differently styled\noutputs.\n\nMake the following changes to your document:\n\n1. Specify **\"code-folding\"** in your YAML document options.\n\n2. Add a table of contents to your document\n\n3. Extra styling...\n\n## Render again!\n\nNotice that when you render the document, all of the code reruns again,\nproducing the same output as before, but with your changes---this is called\nreproducibility!\n\nYou should render **often** while completing your practice activities and lab\nassignments. Make small changes, then make sure the file still renders rather\nthan making a bunch of big changes and then realizing something is wrong.\n\n## Turn it in!\n\nOpen the .html file on your computer to make sure it looks as you expected. Then\nupload the rendered (.html extension) document to Canvas!\n\nDouble check that you have `embed-resources: true` in your YAML. Without this,\nyour html **will not** be formatted correctly on Canvas. You may want to look at\nwhat you turn in through your Canvas portal!\n\n> You'll be doing this same process for all your future Lab Assignments. Each of\nthese will involve a Quarto file. Some weeks, I may have a template for you to\ncopy like you had here, while other weeks you will generate your own Quarto file\nfrom scratch. \n\n",
