Files are organized and well-named.\n\n2. References to data and code work for everyone.\n\n3. Package dependency is clear.\n\n4. Code will run the same every time, even if data values change.\n\n5. Analysis process is well-explained and easy to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Dealing with Directories\n\n</br>\n\n## What is a directory?\n\n- A **directory** is just a fancy name for a folder.\n\n- Your **working directory** is the folder that `R` \"thinks\" it lives in at the\nmoment.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Users/allisontheobold/Documents/Research/IUSE/groupworthy-data-science/videos/week-1\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- If you save things you have created, they save to your working directory by\ndefault.\n\n---\n\nclass: middle \n\n## Paths\n\n- A **path** describes where a certain file or directory lives.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Users/allisontheobold/Documents/Research/IUSE/groupworthy-data-science/videos/week-1\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis file lives in my user files `Users/`, \n\non my account `atheobol/` \n\nin my Documents `Documents` \n\nin a series of organized folders\n\n---\n\nclass: center, middle\n\n# Manage your Class Directory\n\nIs it in a place you can easily find it?\n\n--\n\nDoes it have an informative name?\n\n--\n\nAre the files inside it well-organized?\n\n---\n\n## The Beauty of R Projects\n\n.pull-left[ An **R Project** is basically a \"flag\" planted in a certain\ndirectory.\n\nWhen you double click a **.Rproj** file, it does two things:\n\n1. Open RStudio\n\n2. Set the working directory to be wherever the .Rproj file lives.\n\n3. Link to GitHub, if setup (more on that later!)]\n\n.pull-right[\n![](images/project_flag.jpg)\n]\n\n---\n\nclass: center\n\n# RStudio Projects & Reproducibility\n\n</br> \n\n.bitlarger[This is great for reproducibility!]\n\n</br>\n\n.bitlarger[You can send anyone your folder with your .Rproj file and they will\nbe able to run your code on their computer.]\n\n---\n\nclass: middle\n\n# Setting up an RStudio Project\n\n---\n\nclass: middle \n\n# Good practice\n\n- Organize your folders carefully, and name them meaningfully:\n  * `/User/atheobold/Stat331/lab1/` rather than `Desktop/stuff/`\n    \n- Use **R Projects** liberally - put one in the \"main\" folder for each project\n\n    * I have a project for every class I teach.\n    * I have a project for every data analysis I do.\n    * I **never** work in RStudio, except in a project.\n\n---\n\n# Bad practice\n\nIf you put something like this at the top of your .Rmd file, I will set your \ncomputer on fire:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"/User/reginageorge/Desktop/R_Class/Lab_1/\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- Setting working directory by hand = BAD!  \n\n--\n\n- That directory is specific to you!\n\n--\n\n- R Markdown and Quarto ignore this code when knitting! \n\n---\n\nclass: middle, center\n\n# Do this right now:\n</br>\n### 1. Create a R Project in your class directory.\n</br>\n### 2. Add a folder to the directory called \"Week 1\" or \"Lab 1\"\n</br>\n### 3. Click on your STAT331 R Project to open up RStudio\n</br>\n### 4. Use `getwd()` to find the **path** to your class directory.\n",
