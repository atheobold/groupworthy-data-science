There is no company that owns **R**, like there is for *SAS* or *Matlab*. (*Python* is also open-source!)\n\n. . .\n\n</br>\n\nThis means nobody can sell their **R** code!\n\n-   but you can sell \"helpers\" like **RStudio**\n\n-   and you can keep code **private** within an organization or company\n\n. . .\n\n**Packages are created by users like you and me!**\n\n# Open Source\n\nBeing a good open-source citizen means...\n\n... **sharing** your code publicly when possible.\n\n(We'll learn about how to do this with *GitHub*!)\n\n. . .\n\n... **contributing** to public projects and packages, as you are able.\n\n. . .\n\n... creating your own **packages**, if you can.\n\n. . .\n\n... using **R** for **ethical and respectful** projects.\n\n# Intro to RStudio\n\n## What is RStudio?\n\n. . .\n\n**RStudio** is an IDE (*Integrated Developer Environment*).\n\nThis means it is an application that makes it easier for you to interact with **R**.\n\n. . .\n\n![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0b4d0569b2ddf6147da90b110fbb2a17653c8b08/f06f3/images/shutterstock/r_vs_rstudio_1.png)\n\n## RStudio Layout\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/fig/rstudio_session_4pane_layout.png){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## History of RStudio\n\nIn 2011 RStudio was released by J.J. Allaire.\n\n</br> \n\n. . .\n\nIn 2014, RStudio hired Hadley Wickham as Chief Data Scientist. \n\n*Recall: You cannot sell R code; packages created by RStudio's team are freely available.*\n\n</br> \n\n. . .\n\nIn 2020, RStudio became a PBC (*Public Benefit Corp*), meaning they are legally obligated to support education and open-source development.\n\n. . .\n\n</br> \n\nIn 2023, RStudio became Posit. They now employ over 50 full-time developers (for both R and Python).\n\n",
