Open RStudio\n\n2.  Set the working directory to be wherever the .Rproj file lives.\n\n3.  Link to GitHub, if setup (more on that later!)\\]\n\n.pull-right\\[ ![](images/project_flag.jpg)\\]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nclass: center\n\n# RStudio Projects & Reproducibility\n\n</br>\n\n.bitlarger\\[This is great for reproducibility!\\]\n\n</br>\n\n.bitlarger\\[You can send anyone your folder with your .Rproj file and they will be able to run your code on their computer.\\]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nclass: middle\n\n# Setting up an RStudio Project\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nclass: middle\n\n# Good practice\n\n-   Organize your folders carefully, and name them meaningfully:\n\n    -   `/User/atheobold/Stat331/lab1/` rather than `Desktop/stuff/`\n\n-   Use **R Projects** liberally - put one in the \"main\" folder for each project\n\n    -   I have a project for every class I teach.\n    -   I have a project for every data analysis I do.\n    -   I **never** work in RStudio, except in a project.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Bad practice\n\nIf you put something like this at the top of your .Rmd file, I will set your computer on fire:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"/User/reginageorge/Desktop/R_Class/Lab_1/\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Setting working directory by hand = BAD!\n\n--\n\n-   That directory is specific to you!\n\n",
