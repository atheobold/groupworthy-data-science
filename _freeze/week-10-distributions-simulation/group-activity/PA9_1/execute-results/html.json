He claims to be selling top-quality instruments for a marching band. He begins selling his instruments to all the children in town.\n\nYou are suspicious of Professor Hill, and think that perhaps he is selling instruments made of sub-par materials to scam the townsfolk.\n\nYou do some research on the weights of properly crafted brass instruments, and you learn the following facts:\n\n+ Trombone weights are normally distributed, with a mean weight of 4.6 lbs and a standard deviation of 0.8 lbs.\n\n+ Trumpet weights are uniformly distributed between 1.5 and 3.5 lbs.\n\n+ Reed instruments (like clarinets, bassoons, and saxophones) have weights that are Chi-square distributed with 4 degrees of freedom.\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Remember\n\n**Four Types of Calculations**\n\n+ `p` -- stands for probability (left tail area for a given value of $x$).\n+ `r` -- stands for random (for generating data).\n+ `q` -- stands for quantile (for a given probability).\n+ `d` -- stands for density (of the distribution at a given value of $x$).\n\n**Distributions**\n\n+ The normal distribution functions end with `norm`.\n+ The uniform distribution functions end with `unif`.\n+ The Chi-square distribution functions end with `chisq`.\n:::\n\n## Warm-up\n\n**1. What is the 95th percentile for trumpet weight?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Q1 code\n```\n:::\n\n\n**2. What is the 10th percentile for trombone weight?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Q2 code\n```\n:::\n\n\n**3. About what percent of trombones do you expect to be more than 5 pounds?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Q3 code\n```\n:::\n\n\n**4. About what percent of reed instruments do you expect to be more than 5 pounds?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Q4 code\n```\n:::\n\n\n**5. Simulate 100 random trombone weights. How many of them were below 4 pounds?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Q5 code\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Catching a Con\n\nYou manage to intercept a shipping notice for a delivery to Professor Hill. It says the following:\n\n    Wells Fargo Shipment 1957\n\n    To:  Harold Hill, Mason City, Iowa\n    From:  Music Factory, Gary, Indiana\n\n    Items included:\n        Trombones: 76\n        Cornets: 110\n        Saxophones: 542\n        Clarinets: 318\n        Bassoons: 175\n        \n    Total Shipped Weight: 4532 lbs.\n\nThis is your chance to catch Professor Hill in his lie!\n\n**6. Write a function that samples the correct number of trombones, cornets (trumpets), and reed instruments (saxophones, clarinets, bassoons), and then returns the total weight of the shipment.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmusic_man <- function(n_tromb, n_cor, n_reed){\n  \n  trombones <- rnorm(n_tromb, ...)\n  cornets   <- ...\n  reeds     <- ...\n  \n  ...\n  \n  return()\n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n**7. Use the function you just wrote to create random samples of the total weight of 1000 possible shipments.**\n\n::: callout-caution\n**Do not** change the seed in the code provided below!\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1957)\n\nmy_weights <- map_dbl(.x = 1:1000, \n                      .f = ~ music_man(n_tromb = 76, ...))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError in `map_dbl()`:\nâ„¹ In index: 1.\nCaused by error in `music_man()`:\n! '...' used in an incorrect context\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Canvas submission\n\n> How many of these samples had a weight less than or equal to Professor Hill's shipment? \n>\n> Do you beleive Professor Hill ordered genuine instruments?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Canvas submission code\n```\n:::\n",
