title: "Statistical Computing with R"
---

Have you ever wondered...

-   ...how are the visualizations you see in the media made?

-   ...how do people cut down large datasets to address a specific question?

-   ...how the applet simulations in your statistics classes work? 

We’ll answer these questions and more by studying the principles of “statistical computing” methods in the programming language called R. There is not an expectation that you have seen R before, only that you have some experiences with computing (writing code and executing code). For those who have not seen R before, it is an open-source programming language [developed by Statisticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), and is one of the main “languages” you will find people use when doing statistics in the wild.

In this course, we will learn the foundational skills for programming in R and a variety of skills for working with data. We will then build on these skills to consider how to write programs which are more efficient.
