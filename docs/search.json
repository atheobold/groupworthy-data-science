    "text": "2.1 Examples: Messy Data\nThese datasets all display the same data: TB (Tuberculosis) cases documented by the WHO (World Health Organization) in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China, between 1999 and 2000. There are four variables: country, year, cases, and population, but each table has a different layout.\n\nFor each of the data set, determine whether each table is tidy.\n\nIf it is not, identify which rule(s) it violates.\n\nWhat would you have to do to the data to be able to compute a standardized TB infection rate per 100,000 people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAll of these data sets are ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù to the tidyr package!\n\n\n\nTable 1Table 2Table 3Table 4Table 5\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\ncountry\nyear\ncases\npopulation\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\n745\n19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\n2666\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\n37737\n172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\n80488\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\n212258\n1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\n213766\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, each observation is a single row, each variable is a column, and everything is nicely arranged for e.g.¬†regression or statistical analysis. We can easily compute another measure, such as cases per 100,000 population, by taking cases / population * 100000 (this would define a new column).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\ncountry\nyear\ntype\ncount\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\ncases\n745\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\npopulation\n19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\ncases\n2666\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\npopulation\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\ncases\n37737\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\npopulation\n172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\ncases\n80488\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\npopulation\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\ncases\n212258\n\n\nChina\n1999\npopulation\n1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\ncases\n213766\n\n\nChina\n2000\npopulation\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have 4 columns again, but we now have 12 rows (instead of 6): one of the columns is an indicator of which of two numerical observations is recorded in that row; a second column stores the value (e.g., cases, population). This form of the data is more easily plotted in ggplot2, if we want to show trend lines for both cases and population, but computing per capita cases would be much more difficult in this form than in the arrangement in Table 1!\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\ncountry\nyear\nrate\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\n745/19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\n2666/20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\n37737/172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\n80488/174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\n212258/1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\n213766/1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nThis form has only 3 columns, because the rate variable (which is a character) stores both the case count and the population. We can‚Äôt do anything with this format as it stands, because we can‚Äôt do math on data stored as characters. However, this form might be easier to read and record for a human being.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4a\n\n\ncountry\n1999\n2000\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n745\n2666\n\n\nBrazil\n37737\n80488\n\n\nChina\n212258\n213766\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4b\n\n\ncountry\n1999\n2000\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n19987071\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n172006362\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1272915272\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this form, we have two tables - one for population, and one for cases. Each year‚Äôs observations are in a separate column. This format is often found in separate sheets of an Excel workbook. To work with this data, we‚Äôll need to transform each table so that there is a column indicating which year an observation is from, and then merge the two tables together by country and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5\n\n\ncountry\ncentury\nyear\nrate\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n19\n99\n745/19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n20\n00\n2666/20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n19\n99\n37737/172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n20\n00\n80488/174504898\n\n\nChina\n19\n99\n212258/1272915272\n\n\nChina\n20\n00\n213766/1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 is very similar to Table 3, but the year has been separated into two columns - century, and year. This is more common with year, month, and day in separate columns (or date and time in separate columns), often to deal with the fact that spreadsheets don‚Äôt always handle dates the way you‚Äôd hope they would.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, all data would come in the right format for our needs, but this is often not the case. We will spend the next few weeks learning about how to use R to reformat our data to follow the tidy data framework and see why this is so important. By the end of this chapter, you will have the skills needed to wrangle and transform the most common ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data sets into ‚Äútidy‚Äù form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we always want our data in the same layout?\n\n\n\nThe concept of tidy data is useful for mapping variables from the data set to elements in a graph, specifications of a model, or aggregating to create summaries. However, what is considered to be ‚Äútidy data‚Äù format for one task, might not be in the correct ‚Äútidy data‚Äù format for a different task. It is important for you to consider the end goal when restructuring your data.\nPart of this course is building the skills for you to be able to map your data operation steps from an original data set to the correct format (and output)."

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important‚Äîsuch as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the ‚Äúfile system‚Äù metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. [This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn‚Äôt play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nIn this class, we will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na ‚ÄúStat 331‚Äù folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 331\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)\na separate R Studio Project (and GitHub repository) associated with each assignment\n\nFor example, if you come to my office for help on your lab assignment for Week 2, I would expect your files to look like this:\n\nFile Storage on WindowsFile Storage on a Mac\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named ‚ÄúSTAT 331.‚Äù\n\nInside my STAT 331 folder is a sub-folder named ‚ÄúWeek 1,‚Äù which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named ‚ÄúLab 1.‚Äù You can tell what folders Lab 1 lives inside based on the information included at the top of the screen. This is called a ‚Äúfile path,‚Äù which tells your computer where a folder / file lives on the computer.\nOn a PC, every file lives on the C Drive, so the ‚Äúfull path‚Äù to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\nC:/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named ‚ÄúSTAT 331.‚Äù Inside this folder is a sub-folder named ‚ÄúWeek 1,‚Äù which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named ‚ÄúLab 1.‚Äù\nOn a Mac, every file lives on the hard drive (it doesn‚Äôt have letters like a PC), so the ‚Äúfull path‚Äù to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\n/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1",

While expected learning outcomes were not changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could have implications for data.\nAverage SET scores were combined with many other variables, including:\n\ncharacteristics of the teacher (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in the past 6 semesters).\ncharacteristics of the course (time of day, day of the week, course type, course breadth, class duration, class size).\npercentage of students providing SET feedback.\ncourse grades (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the current course and previous 6 semesters).\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new hypotheses.\nBefore tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable included in the teacher_evals_codebook.pdf inside the ‚Äúresources‚Äù folder.\n1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis.\n\n# code chunk for loading packages\n\n2. Load in the teacher_evals data. Hint: You should use the here() function from the here package!\n\n# code chunk for importing the data\n\n\nData Inspection + Summary\n3. Provide a brief overview (~4 sentences) of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to start an analysis by getting a feel for the data and providing a quick summary for readers. You do not need to show any code for this question, although you probably want to use code to get some information about the data (e.g., summary(data), glimpse(data), dim(data), etc.). Things to think about ‚Äì where did the data come from? what sort of data are provided (context and data type)? how much data do you have? etc.\n\n\n\n# you may want to use code to answer this question\n\n4. What is the unit of observation (i.e.¬†a single row in the dataset) identified by?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is not one instructor per row! It‚Äôs also not just one class per row!\n\n\n\n# you may want to use code to answer this question\n\n5. Use one dplyr pipeline to clean the data by:\n\nrenaming the gender variable sex\nremoving all courses with fewer than 10 respondents\nchanging data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID really a numeric data type?)\nonly keeping the columns we will use ‚Äì course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share, SET_score_avg, percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, and sex\n\nAssign your cleaned data to a new variable named teacher_evals_clean ‚Äì- use these data going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: rename(), mutate(), as.factor()\nIt would be most efficient to use across() in combination with mutate() to complete this task.\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q4\n\n5. How many unique instructors and unique courses are present in the cleaned dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: summarize(), n_distinct()\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q5\n\n6. One teacher-course combination has some missing values, coded as NA. Which instructor has these missing values? Which course?

Investigate the variables academic_degree, seniority, and sex and summarize your findings in ~3 complete sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll need to first wrangle your data to have each instructor represented only once.\nHelpful functions: select(), distinct(___, .keep_all = TRUE), count(), summary()\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q7\n\n8.

    "section": "",
    "text": "For this week‚Äôs Challenge, you will have three different options to explore. I‚Äôve arranged these options in terms of their ‚Äúspiciness,‚Äù or the difficulty of completing the task. You are only required to complete one task, but if you are interested in exploring more than one, feel free!\nThis is a great place to let your creativity show! Make sure to indicate what additional touches you added, and provide any online references you used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will be working in the challenge-2.qmd file, found in the repository you cloned for Lab 2. Within this document, make sure to specify that your plots are contained in your document (self-contained: true) and that your code is visible to the reader (echo: true). If there are other formatting specifics you would like to include, feel free to toss those in the YAML, too!\nThen, create a setup code chunk to load the packages and read in the surveys.csv data file exactly how you did in Lab 2.\nCreate another code chunk and paste in your code from Question 14 or Question 15 in Lab 2 ‚Äì we will be modifying the box plot of weights by species!\n\n\n\nüå∂ Medium: Ridge Plots\nIn Lab 2, you used side-by-side boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species of rodent. Boxplots have substantial flaws, namely that they disguise distributions with multiple modes.\nA ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù alternative is the density plot. However, ggplot2 does not allow for side-by-side density plots using geom_density(). Instead, we will need to make use of the ggridges package to create side-by-side density (ridge) plots.\n\nFor this challenge you are to change your boxplots to ridge plots. You will need to install the ggridges package and explore the geom_density_ridges() function.\n\n\n\nüå∂ üå∂ Spicy: Exploring Color Themes\nThe built-in ggplot() color scheme may not include the colors you were looking for. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì there are many other color palettes available to use!\nYou can change the colors used by ggplot() in a few different ways.\n\nManual Specification\nAdd the scale_color_manual() or scale_fill_manual() functions to your plot and directly specify the colors you want to use. You can either:\n\ndefine a vector of colors within the scale functions (e.g. values = c(\"blue\", \"black\", \"red\", \"green\")) OR\ncreate a vector of colors using hex numbers and store that vector as a variable. Then, call that vector in the scale_color_manual() function.\n\nHere are some exaplme hex color schemes:\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with gray:\ncdPalette_grey &lt;- c(\"#999999\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with black:\ncdPalette_blk &lt;- c(\"#000000\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in using specific hex colors, I like the image color picker app to find the colors I want.\n\n\n\n\nPackage Specification\nWhile manual specification may be necessary for some contexts, it can be a real pain to handpick 5+ colors. This is where color scales built-in to R packages come in handy! Popular packages for colors include:\n\nRColorBrewer ‚Äì change colors by using scale_fill_brewer() or scale_colour_brewer().\nviridis ‚Äì change colors by using scale_colour_viridis_d() for discrete data, scale_colour_viridis_c() for continuous data.\nggsci ‚Äì change colors by using scale_color_&lt;PALNAME&gt;() or scale_fill_&lt;PALNAME&gt;(), where you specify the name of the palette you wish to use (e.g.¬†scale_color_aaas()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website provides an exhaustive list of color themes available through various packages.\n\n\n\nIn this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable genus. Next, you are to change the colors used for genus using either manual color specification or any of the packages listed here (or others!).\n\n\n\n\nüå∂ üå∂ üå∂ Hot: Exploring ggplot2 Annotation\nSome data scientists advocate that we should try to eliminate legends from our plots to make them more clear. Instead of using legends, which cause the reader‚Äôs eye to stray from the plot, we should use annotation.\nWe can add annotation(s) to a ggplot() using the annotate() function:\n\nggplot(data = surveys, \n       mapping = aes(y = species,\n                     x = weight,\n                     color = genus)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cdPalette_grey) + \n  annotate(\"text\", y = 6, x = 250, label = \"Sigmodon\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", y = 4, x = 250, label = \"Perognathus\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (g)\",\n       y = \"\",\n       subtitle = \"Species\",\n       title = \"Rodent Weight by Species\")\n\nNote that I‚Äôve labeled the ‚ÄúSigmodon‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerognathus‚Äù genera, so the reader can tell that these boxplots are associated with their respective genus.\n\nIn this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created in Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable genus. Next, you are to add annotations for each genus next to the boxplot(s) associated with that genus. Finally, you are expected to use the theme() function to remove the color legend from the plot, since it is no longer needed!"

    "text": "Dealing with Errors\nAs you work through this PA, you will encounter some code that does not work as you want it to. Don‚Äôt despair! Errors (when R is unable to run your code) and bugs (when the code doesn‚Äôt do what you hoped) are a natural part of coding. Even the best of the best deal with these problems regularly - learning to track down the issue is a skill that you can learn and practice.\nErrors can be sneaky - check results often!\nIf a chunk of code runs smoothly without giving you an error or warning this does not necessarily mean it accomplished the desired task.\nIt is a good habit to check the results of your code every time you finish a task. In general, I would recommend completing the following tasks every time you write a code chunk.\n\nInclude a comment at the beginning of the code chunk that briefly states the purpose of the chunk. Comments in the code chunks come after # signs. These comments will remind later readers‚Äîwhich might be your future self!‚Äîwhat the desired output of the code chunk is.\nIf you created a new object, take a look at it! You can inspect the object by either clicking its name in your Environment tab or by typing its name into the console. Make sure it looks about how you expect. Do not type code to inspect the object in your Quarto file, as that is not code that needs to be saved!\nIf you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped. Use the Environment or the head() function to investigate your changes."

Write your own code to complete the steps, in the order given below.\n\nAdd 14 to every number.\nMultiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.\nUse the exp() function to exponentiate every number.\nSquare every number.\n\nHint: To update a vector after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with its updated counterpart. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x.\n\n## Code to carry out steps 6-9 \n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 352 numbers in the secret message that are below 17. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a ‚Äúrelational‚Äù comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it ‚Äúevens‚Äù. That is, ‚Äúevens‚Äù should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 ‚Ä¶, 382.\nSubtract the ‚Äúevens‚Äù vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Code to carry out steps 10-15\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\nHint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\n# Code for steps 16-18\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn‚Äôt done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder.

When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt‚Äôs not enough to say ‚Äú[x] was wrong, so I fixed it‚Äù‚ÄîI need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn‚Äôt know before?

    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two ‚Äúroles‚Äù‚ÄîDeveloper and Coder. We will discuss these roles in class, but you can find descriptions of the scope of each role on the Pair Programming Roles document.\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is ‚ÄúPrograms must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.‚Äù Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else‚Äôs code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing ‚Äútidy‚Äù and ‚Äúefficient‚Äù code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone‚Äôs code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It‚Äôs easy to be a jerk when making comments; don‚Äôt. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other.",

    "text": "12.1 How do you define plagiarism in a programming class?\nParaphrasing or quoting another‚Äôs work without citing the source is a form of academic misconduct. This included the R code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.\nIn this class the assumed knowledge is the course materials, including the course textbook, coursework pages, and course slides. Any functions / code used outside of these materials require direct references. This includes any functions learned through R documentation for functions we have learned. Meaning, if you look up the help file for mutate() and you learn about a function not covered in the course materials, you are required to cite the documentation when using that function.\nEven inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another‚Äôs work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you use external resources such as Google or ChatGPT, I expect you to indicate this in your assignment.\n\nIf you used Google, you are expected to ‚Äúinform‚Äù me of any resources you used by pasting the link to the resource in a code comment next to where you used that resource.\nIf you used ChatGPT, you are expected to ‚Äúinform‚Äù me of the assistance you received by (1) indicating somewhere in the problem that you used ChatGPT (e.g., below the question prompt or as a code comment), and (2) downloading and attaching the .txt file containing your entire conversation with ChatGPT.\n\nIt is both good professional practice and academic integrity to cite any resources you used during your work. The first incident of failing to cite your resources, will result in a warning. The second incident of failing to cite your resources will result in a 0 on the assignment, meaning you will not be able to include any code from that Lab or Challenge in your Final Portfolio. You will also be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.\nIf you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.",

Your code would be much easier to read if you used spaces before and after your = signs and after each comma. I would also recommend hitting enter / return after each + sign, so that each‚Äùlayer‚Äù of your plot has its own line. This makes it easier to digest what is happening at each stage of your plot.‚Äù\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% mutate(mass_flipper_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%   group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(avg_mass_flipper_ratio = median(mass_flipper_ratio)) %&gt;% arrange(avg_mass_flipper_ratio)\n\nMy Review\n‚ÄúI really appreciate how you use spaces before and after each = sign, that makes it easier to read how each = sign is being used. I also have a suggestion for your code formatting which would make your code easier to read. If you use a return / new line after each %&gt;% sign, each step of your pipeline is on its own line and it is easier to understand the process you are implementing.‚Äù\n\n\ncolleges_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(REGION == 7,\n         ADM_RATE &gt; region_median,\n         TUITION_DIFF != 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    SAT_odd = SAT_AVG %% 2 != 0\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(SAT_odd == TRUE,\n         STABBR != \"ID\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    freshman = as.numeric(UGDS) / 4, \n    applications = freshman / ADM_RATE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(applications &lt; 1000, \n         STABBR != \"MT\")\n\nMy Review\n‚ÄúYour code formatting is awesome! I really appreciate your use of whitespace and returns to break up your code and make it more readable. The main suggestion I have is to pay attention to how many times you are calling the same function during your data wrangling process. For example, in your code you use the filter() function three times. Could you do all this filtering in one call to the filter() function? That would help make your code more efficient!‚Äù"

Thus, if you send an email after 4pm on Friday or during the weekend, you will not receive a response until Monday morning.\nIf your question is much easier to discuss face-to-face, I may ask you to meet with me in my office or on Discord (at a time that works for both of us) rather than answering directly in an email.\nInclude any relevant photos / screenshots / error messages / PDFs / links with your email.",

I design all my courses with accessibility at the forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let‚Äôs talk to each other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal processes.\n\n\nI‚Äôm having difficulty paying for food and rent, what can I do?\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.\n\n\nMy mental health is impairing my ability to engage in my classes, what should I do?\nNational surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly are here to help you. Cal Poly‚Äôs Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.\n\n\nSomeone is threatening me, what can I do?\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to dating violence and stalking.\n\n\nWhat if I can‚Äôt arrange for childcare?\nIf you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know.",

The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database is an open source data set containing time series on the military spending of countries from 1949‚Äì2019. The database is updated annually, which may include updates to data from previous years.\nMilitary expenditure is presented in many ways:\n\nin local currency and in US $ (both from 2018 and current);\nin terms of financial years and calendar years;\nas a share of GDP and per capita.\n\nThe availability of data varies considerably by country, but we note that data is available from at least the late 1950s for a majority of countries that were independent at the time. Estimates for regional military expenditure have been extended backwards depending on availability of data, but no estimates for total world military expenditure are available before 1988 due to the lack of data from the Soviet Union.\nSIPRI military expenditure data is based on open sources only."

Let‚Äôs add transparency (alpha) to the points, to make the points more transparent and (possibly) easier to see.\n\nDespite our best efforts there is still a substantial amount of overplotting occurring in our scatterplot. Let‚Äôs try splitting the dataset into smaller subsets and see if that allows for us to see the trends a bit better.\n6. Facet your scatterplot by species.\n\n7. No plot is complete without axis labels and a title. Include reader friendly labels and a title to your plot.\n\nIt takes a larger cognitive load to read text that is rotated. It is common practice in many journals and media outlets to move the \\(y\\)-axis label to the top of the graph under the title.\n8. Specify your \\(y\\)-axis label to be empty and move the \\(y\\)-axis label into the subtitle.",

However, with ggplot we can add the raw points on top of the boxplots!\n11. Add another layer to your previous plot that plots each observation.\n\nAlright, this should look less than optimal. Your points should appear rather stacked on top of each other. To make them less stacked, we need to jitter them a bit, using geom_jitter().\n12. Remove the previous layer and include a geom_jitter() layer instead.\n\nThat should look a bit better! But its really hard to see the points when everything is black.\n13. Set the color aesthetic in geom_jitter() to change the color of the points and add set the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to use whatever color you wish! Some of my favorites are ‚Äúorange3‚Äù and ‚Äústeelblue‚Äù.\n\n\nGreat! Now that you can see the points, you should notice something odd: there are two colors of points still being plotted. Some of the observations are being plotted twice, once from geom_boxplot() as outliers and again from geom_jitter()!\n14. Inspect the help file for geom_boxplot() and see how you can remove the outliers from being plotted by geom_boxplot(). Make this change in your code!\n\nSome small changes can make big differences to plots. One of these changes are better labels for a plot‚Äôs axes and legend.\n15. Modify the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to describe what is being plotted. Be sure to include any necessary units! You might also be getting overlap in the species names ‚Äì use theme(axis.text.x = ____) or theme(axis.text.y = ____) to turn the species axis labels 45 degrees.\n\nSome people (and journals) prefer for boxplots to be stacked with a specific orientation! Let‚Äôs practice changing the orientation of our boxplots.\n16. Now copy-paste your boxplot code you‚Äôve been adding to above. Flip the orientation of your boxplots. If you created horizontally stacked boxplots, your boxplots should now be stacked vertically. If you had vertically stacked boxplots, you should now stack your boxplots horizontally!\nNotice how vertically stacked boxplots make the species labels more readable than horizontally stacked boxplots (even when the axis labels are rotated). This is good practice!",

Create a ca_childcare dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the childcare_costs dataset. Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.\n3. Using a function from the forcats package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the 10 Census regions in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.\n\nca_childcare &lt;- ca_childcare |&gt; \n  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, \" County\")) |&gt;\n  ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI have provided you with code that eliminates the word ‚ÄúCounty‚Äù from each of the county names in your ca_childcare dataset.

Let‚Äôs consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the median of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the region and the study_year. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions!\n\n\n5. Which California region had the lowest median full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this region correspond to the region with the lowest median income in 2018 that you found in Q4?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.\n\n\n6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data!

(Much like this one!)\nThese are meant to replace the in-class lecture experience; thus, you should plan to devote about 1 - 3 hours a week to this coursework.\n\n\nPreview Activities\nDue Tuesdays before the beginning of class (at 12pm)\nBefore class, you‚Äôll complete Preview Activities which will guide you through your first contact with new concepts.\nThese will involve readings, videos, along with exercises to build your basic skill fluency. For example, you might be asked to read a chapter from the course textbook, watch a few videos discussing some concepts from the chapter, and then asked to complete some preliminary exercises intended to get you started thinking about how to apply the concepts from the chapter in the context of real data.\nYou‚Äôll submit these exercises online, so that class time can be customized based on your understanding.\n\n\nPractice Activities\nDue Wednesdays at midnight\nDuring class, you‚Äôll be working with your classmates to complete Practice Activities, which take your Preview Activities a step further. You will collaborate with your team to solve a puzzle, requiring that you accomplish a series of tasks, each of which applies the statistical computing concepts from that week. The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost.\nThe course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the activity.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nDue Sundays at midnight\nAfter class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you‚Äôve learned. If you got something wrong, don‚Äôt worry! You‚Äôll have a chance to try again.\nLabs will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Lab Assignments will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment.\n\n\nChallenges\nDue Sundays at midnight\nEach Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem, which asks you to extend the skills you‚Äôve learned in class in some way. Frequently, you have the choice of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\nAlthough you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text absolutely must be your own.\nChallenges will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Challenges will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment.",

For example, the latest version of R as of July 1, 2024 was R-4.4.1 (Race for Your Life).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you‚Äôre going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can‚Äôt, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on ‚ÄúDownload R for Linux‚Äù and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

Unlike other graphics classification schemes, the grammar of graphics makes an attempt to describe how the data set itself relates to the components of the chart.\nThis has a few advantages:\n\nIt‚Äôs relatively easy to represent the same data set with different types of plots (and to find their strengths and weaknesses)\nGrammar leads to a concise description of the plot and its contents\nWe can add layers to modify the graphics, each with their own basic grammar (just like we combine sentences and clauses to build a rich, descriptive paragraph)\n\n\n\n\nA pyramid view of the major components of the grammar of graphics, with data as the base, aesthetics building on data, scales building on aesthetics, geometric objects, statistics, facets, and the coordinate system at the top of the pyramid.

Your goal is to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade. Please be thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.¬†\nThis reflection will be done in the reflection_template Quarto file provided in the repository. The structure of the document is as follows:\n\nWhat grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.\n\n\nFor each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.¬†\n\nSome learning targets ask for one example, some ask for two examples, and some ask for specific examples relative to particular data types.\n\n\nYour Lab assignments and Challenge problems should be a primary source of these examples, but you can also include other items. Anything that supports your argument for a grade can be submitted.\n\n\nYou must indicate where the code you provided came from, including the title of the assignment and problem number either next to the code title (e.g., xlsx - Lab 2 Question 1) or as a code comment at the top of the code chunk.\n\n\nNote, your code is not expected to run! The execute options at the top of the Quarto file are set to eval: false. Thus, you do not need to load in any packages or datasets in your reflection.¬†\n\n\n\nHow did you meet that grade‚Äôs requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the Are there ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù for how I should award myself a grade? section of the syllabus. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you‚Äôve earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you‚Äôve met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.\nWhat else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn‚Äôt explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you‚Äôre thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough ‚Äî and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.\n\nPlus/minus grades: You may argue to add a ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äù modifier to your grade. Generally speaking a ‚Äú+‚Äù added to a letter grade means you‚Äôve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a ‚Äú-‚Äù means that you have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare minimum, or you‚Äôve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small number of minor criteria."

Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them. Don‚Äôt just give a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so we know them already). Focus instead on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth. Explain in this essay how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.\n\n\nThe power of efficiency: As we‚Äôve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Include: What is the definition of ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù? What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science? What does efficiency allow you to do? Why is efficiency important? Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moments you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)\n\n\nLightning round: Answer each of the following questions with one sentence including a brief explanation.\n\nFinish the sentence with another student‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúIf [Student] doesn‚Äôt earn an A, then nobody should, because‚Ä¶‚Äù Explain your choice and your reasoning.\nWhat was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.\nWhat was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.\nWhat part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.\nGive one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 that will help them be successful in learning."

It‚Äôs possible that STAT 331 has been the most challenging course on your schedule this quarter, perhaps in your entire college career so far. I want you to know that I see you, I respect your efforts, and it‚Äôs extremely fulfilling to see you respond to the challenges and grow.\nI also want to be clear that while the time and effort spent on the class are vitally important, they are not explicitly part of the grade criteria you find in the syllabus. So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, I respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class.\nYou are free to discuss your investment in time and effort in the essay questions if you like, or apart from the portfolio if that makes more sense. But when making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of your investment of time and effort. Did your efforts result in several exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made you a valuable group member."

That is, you grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you‚Äôve provided supports this grade. If this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting.I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this feedback when constructing your final portfolio. If I believe the grade you‚Äôve proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you‚Äôve provided, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting.I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your grade request is correct, you‚Äôll have the chance to walk me through your materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the evidence supports. I have faith that we‚Äôll be able to come to a mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can‚Äôt, I will assign the grade that in my estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply overriding your grade determination.\n\n\nYou ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. That is, you ‚Äúlowball‚Äù yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you earned, and then just inform you that I‚Äôve done so (and why)."

Quality, not quantity is what we are after. We do not want every assignment in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in fewer than 8 assignments with judicious selection of homework solutions and other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a massive binder of mediocre examples.\nQ: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone‚Äôs question on Discord?\nA: This isn‚Äôt filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn‚Äôt necessary. Details and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness here. For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord, pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you say? Why was that comment an example of ‚Äúhelpful feedback‚Äù? (Do you know that it was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you‚Äôve earned a particular grade.\nQ: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a ‚ÄúD‚Äù in the class?\nA: Yes, if the person is honest and there‚Äôs not enough evidence to make the case for a ‚ÄúC‚Äù. If you‚Äôre in that situation, be honest and don‚Äôt overreach just because the consequences are significant.\nQ: How long should the essays be?\nA: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses ‚Äî without going overboard and writing more than you need. There is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.\nQ: What if you do not submit a final portfolio?\nA: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion. I will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.¬†¬†\nWe‚Äôll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up."
