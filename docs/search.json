    "section": "2.1 Is every function vectorized?",
    "text": "2.1 Is every function vectorized?\nShort answer, no. There exist occasions where you either can’t or choose not to write a function that is vectorized. For example, if the function you’ve written makes use of if() statements, your function cannot operate on vectors. For example, take the pos_neg_zero() function below:\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  if(x &gt; 0){\n    return(\"Greater than 0!\")\n  } else if (x &lt; 0){\n    return(\"Less than 0!\")\n  } else {\n    return(\"Equal to 0!\")\n      }\n}\n\nWhen I call the pos_neg_zero() function on a vector I receive an error:\n\nx &lt;- seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\nError in if (x &gt; 0) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nThis error means that the if(x &gt; 0) condition can only be checked for something of length 1. So, to use this function on the vector x, you would need to apply the function individually to each element:\n\nresult &lt;- rep(NA, \n              length(x)\n              )\n\nfor(i in 1:length(x)){\n  result[i] &lt;- pos_neg_zero(x[i])\n}\n\nresult\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector initialization\n\n\n\nNote that I initialized a result vector to store the results of calling the pos_neg_zero() function for the vector x. Similar to C++ and Java, R is an assembly language that requires objects be created before they are used, which is why I couldn’t initialize result inside the for()-loop. Second, when I initialized the result vector I made it the size I wanted, rather than iteratively making it larger and larger (which makes operations incredibly slow).\n\n\nYes, I could have written a “better” function which used a vectorized function (e.g., case-when()) instead of a non-vectorized function (e.g., if()).\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  state &lt;- case_when(x &gt; 0 ~ \"Greater than 0!\", \n                     x &lt; 0 ~ \"Less than 0!\", \n                     .default = \"Equal to 0!\")\n  return(state)\n}\n\nWhen I call this function on the vector x, I no longer receive an error:\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\nThat’s because the case_when() is vectorized!"

    "text": "2.2 When can’t you vectorize your function?\nIt is not always the case that we can write a “better” vectorized function. For example, let’s suppose we are interested in finding the datatype of each column in a data frame. The typeof() function can tell us the datatype of a specific column in the penguins data frame:\n\ntypeof(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nBut, I want the datatype of every column in the penguins data frame! But applying the typeof() function to penguins returns the object structure of the penguins data frame, not the datatype of its columns.\n\ntypeof(penguins)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nWhat can you do? Well, we could rely on our old CS 101 friend, the for()-loop:\n\ndata_type &lt;- rep(NA, \n                 length = ncol(penguins)\n                 )\n\nfor(i in 1:ncol(penguins)){\n  data_type[i] &lt;- typeof(penguins[[i]])\n}\n\n## Getting a nicely formatted table!\ntibble(column = names(penguins), \n       type = data_type) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = column, \n              values_from = type) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\ninteger\ninteger\ndouble\ndouble\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, for()-loops are not as important as they are in other languages because R is a functional programming language. In fact, we would prefer not to use for()-loops as they do not take advantage of R’s functional programming. Take for example, our friend across() that we talked about at the beginning of this reading:\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    across(\n      .cols = everything(), \n      .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x))\n      )\n    ) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n11\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe across() function looks like an “ordinary” function, it applies a specified function / functions to the columns specified. However, when you look at the source code for across() you will find a for()-loop:\n\nfor (j in seq_fns) {\n  fn &lt;- fns[[j]]\n  out[[k]] &lt;- fn(col, ...)\n  k &lt;- k + 1L\n  }\n\nThis shows you that it is possible to include for()-loops in a function, and call that function instead of using the for()-loop directly."

For example, If we wanted to standardize a numeric variable to be centered at the mean and scaled by the standard deviation, we could use the following function:\n\n\nstandardize &lt;- function(vec) {\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(vec))\n  \n  # Center with mean\n  deviations &lt;- vec - mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  # Scale with standard deviation\n  newdata &lt;- deviations / sd(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  return(newdata)\n}\n\nWhy does the following return a vector of NAs?\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    body_mass_g = map_dbl(body_mass_g, standardize)\n  )\n\n\nBecause body_mass_g needs to be passed to standardize() as an argument\nBecause mutate() operates on rows, so map_dbl() is supplying standardize() with one row of body_mass_g at a time\nBecause map_dbl() only takes one input, so you need to use map2_dbl() instead\nBecause there is no function named standardize(), so it cannot be applied to the body_mass_g column\nbody_mass_g is not a data frame so it is not a valid argument for map_dbl()\n\n\nThus far in the course, we have used the across() function to apply the same function to multiple columns. For example, if we wanted to apply the standardize() function from above to every numeric column, we could use the following code:\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), \n                .fns = standardize)\n         )\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.883         0.784            -1.42      -0.563 \n 2 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.810         0.126            -1.06      -0.501 \n 3 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.663         0.430            -0.421     -1.19  \n 4 Adelie  Torgersen         NA            NA                NA         NA     \n 5 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.32          1.09             -0.563     -0.937 \n 6 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.847         1.75             -0.776     -0.688 \n 7 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.920         0.329            -1.42      -0.719 \n 8 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.865         1.24             -0.421      0.590 \n 9 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.80          0.480            -0.563     -0.906 \n10 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.352         1.54             -0.776      0.0602\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWhich of the following map functions would return the same output?\n\n## Option (a)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize)\n\n## Option (b)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()\n\n## Option (c)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) \n\n## Option (d)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()"

What is happening inside the computer’s memory as goodpup() runs?\n\n\n\nA sketch of the execution of the program goodpup, showing that name is only defined within the local environment that is created while goodpup is running. We can never access name in our global environment.\n\n\nThis is why the distinction between arguments and parameters matters. Parameters are only accessible while inside of the function. In that local environment, we need to call the object by the parameter name, not the name we use outside the function (the argument name).\nWe can even call a function with an argument that isn’t defined outside of the function call: goodpup(\"Walle\") produces “Walle is a good pup!”. Here, I do not have a variable storing the string \"Walle\", but I can make the function run anyways. So \"Walle\" here is an argument to goodpup but it is not a variable in my environment.\nThis is a confusing set of concepts and it’s ok if you only just sort of get what I’m trying to explain here.

But you can’t guarantee that the person using your function knows that they need a certain type of input. In these cases, it’s best to validate your function input.\nThe heart of input validation are two functions—stopifnot() and stop(). While these functions have similar behavior they are used in quite different ways. Before we explore these differences, let’s do a refresher on conditional statements and learn about the if(), else(), and else if() functions in R.\n\nConditional Statements\n\n📖 Required Reading: R4DS – Conditional Statements\n\n\n\nstop() & stopifnot()\nIn R, you can use stopifnot() to check for certain essential conditions.

    "section": "2.4 Scope",
    "text": "2.4 Scope\nWhen talking about functions, for the first time we start to confront a critical concept in programming, which is scope. Scope is the part of the program where the name you’ve given a variable is valid - that is, where you can use a variable.\n\n\n\n\nA variable is only available from inside the region it is created.\n\nWhat do I mean by the region of a program? The lexical scope is the portion of the code (the set of lines of code) where the name is valid.\nThe concept of scope is best demonstrated through a series of examples, so in the rest of this section, I’ll show you some examples of how scope works and the concepts that help you figure out what “scope” actually means in practice.\n\nName Masking\nScope is most clearly demonstrated when we use the same variable name inside and outside a function. Note that this is 1) bad programming practice, and 2) fairly easily avoided if you can make your names even slightly more creative than a, b, and so on. But, for the purposes of demonstration, I hope you’ll forgive my lack of creativity in this area so that you can see how name masking works.\nWhat does this function return, 10 or 20?\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n\n\n\n\nA sketch of the global environment as well as the environment within myfun(). Because a = 20 inside myfun(), when we call myfun(), we get the value of a within that environment, instead of within the global environment.\n\n\n\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 20\n\na\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lexical scope of the function is the area that is between the braces. Outside the function, a has the value of 10, but inside the function, a has the value of 20. So when we call myfun(), we get 20, because the scope of myfun is the local context where a is evaluated, and the value of a in that environment dominates.\nThis is an example of name masking, where names defined inside of a function mask names defined outside of a function.\n\n\nEnvironments and Scope\nAnother principle of scoping is that if you call a function and then call the same function again, the function’s environment is re-created each time. Each function call is unrelated to the next function call when the function is defined using local variables.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if aa is not defined\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  else\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n}\n\nmyfun()\nmyfun()\n\nWhat does this output?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we define myfun, we create a template for an environment with variables and code to excecute. Each time myfun() is called, that template is used to create a new environment. This prevents successive calls to myfun() from affecting each other – which means a = 1 every time.\n\n\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if (!exists(\"aa\")) {\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  } else {\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n  }\n  return(aa)\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Lookup\nScoping determines where to look for values. However, when to look for values is determined by the sequence of steps in the code. When a function is called, the calling environment (the global environment or set of environments at the time the function is called) determines what values are used.\nIf an object doesn’t exist in the function’s environment, the global environment will be searched next; if there is no object in the global environment, the program will error out. This behavior, combined with changes in the calling environment over time, can mean that the output of a function can change based on objects outside of the function.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function(){\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\nWhat will the output be of this code?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of the global environment at the time the function is called (that is, the state of the calling environment) can change the results of the function\n\n\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 15\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the following function return?

    "text": "2.5 Debugging\nNow that you’re writing functions, it’s time to talk a bit about debugging techniques. This is a lifelong topic - as you become a more advanced programmer, you will need to develop more advanced debugging skills as well (because you’ll become more adept at screwing things up).\n\n\n\nThe faces of debugging (by Allison Horst)\n\n\nLet’s start with the basics: print debugging.\n\nPrint Debugging\nThis technique is basically exactly what it sounds like. You insert a ton of print statements to give you an idea of what is happening at each step of the function.\nLet’s try it out on the previous example (see what I did there?)\nNote that I’ve modified the code slightly so that we store the value into returnval and then return it later - this allows us to see the code execution without calling functions twice (which would make the print output a bit more confusing).\n\nf &lt;- function(x) {\n  print (\"Entering Outer Function\")\n  print (paste(\"x =\", x))\n  f &lt;- function(x) {\n    print (\"Entering Middle Function\")\n    print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n    f &lt;- function() {\n      print (\"Entering Inner Function\")\n      print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n      print (paste(\"Inner Function: Returning\", x^2))\n      x ^ 2\n    }\n    returnval &lt;- f() + 1\n    print (paste(\"Middle Function: Returning\", returnval))\n    returnval\n  }\n  returnval &lt;- f(x) * 2\n  print (paste(\"Outer Function: Returning\", returnval))\n  returnval\n}\nf(10)\n\n[1] \"Entering Outer Function\"\n[1] \"x = 10\"\n[1] \"Entering Middle Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Entering Inner Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Inner Function: Returning 100\"\n[1] \"Middle Function: Returning 101\"\n[1] \"Outer Function: Returning 202\"\n\n\n[1] 202\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Debugging Strategies\n\nDebugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.\nA t-shirt I saw once\n\nThe overall process is well described in Advanced R by H. Wickham; I’ve copied it here because it’s such a succinct distillation of the process, but I’ve adapted some of the explanations to this class rather than the original context of package development.\n\nRealize that you have a bug\nGoogle! In R you can automate this with the errorist and searcher packages, but general Googling the error + the programming language + any packages you think are causing the issue is a good strategy.\nMake the error repeatable: This makes it easier to figure out what the error is, faster to iterate, and easier to ask for help.\n\nUse binary search (remove 1/2 of the code, see if the error occurs, if not go to the other 1/2 of the code. Repeat until you’ve isolated the error.)\nGenerate the error faster - use a minimal test dataset, if possible, so that you can ask for help easily and run code faster. This is worth the investment if you’ve been debugging the same error for a while.\nNote which inputs don’t generate the bug – this negative “data” is helpful when asking for help.\n\nFigure out where it is. Debuggers may help with this, but you can also use the scientific method to explore the code, or the tried-and-true method of using lots of print() statements.\nFix it and test it. The goal with tests is to ensure that the same error doesn’t pop back up in a future version of your code. Generate an example that will test for the error, and add it to your documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Minimal Reproducible Examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThese section is included as FYI, but you don’t have to read it just now. It’s important, but not urgent, if that makes sense.\nIf all else has failed, and you can’t figure out what is causing your error, it’s probably time to ask for help. If you have a friend or buddy that knows the language you’re working in, by all means ask for help sooner. But when you ask for help online, often you’re asking people who are much more knowledgeable about the topic - members of R core browse StackOverflow and may drop in and help you out. Under those circumstances, it’s better to make the task of helping you as easy as possible because it shows respect for their time. The same thing goes for your supervisors and professors. 🙃\n\n\n\nThe reprex R package will help you make a reproducible example (drawing by Allison Horst)\n\n\nSo, with that said, there are numerous resources for writing what’s called a “minimal working example”, “reproducible example” (commonly abbreviated reprex), or MCVE (minimal complete verifiable example). Much of this is lifted directly from the StackOverflow post describing a minimal reproducible example.\nThe goal is to reproduce the error message with information that is\n\nminimal - as little code as possible to still reproduce the problem\ncomplete - everything necessary to reproduce the issue is contained in the description/question\nreproducible - test the code you provide to reproduce the problem.\n\nYou should format your question to make it as easy as possible to help you. Make it so that code can be copied from your post directly and pasted into an R script or notebook (e.g. Quarto document code chunk). Describe what you see and what you’d hope to see if the code were working.\nOther resources:\n\nreprex package: Do’s and Don’ts\nHow to use the reprex package - Vignette with videos from the Jenny Bryan\nreprex magic - Vignette adapted from a blog post by Nick Tierney"

    "text": "1 Simulation in R\n\n📖 Required Reading: R Programming for Data Science : Simulation\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ : Check-in 9.1: Distributions & Simulation\nQuestion 1: What does the output of pnorm(-4, mean = 2, sd = 4) mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDrawing pictures of the relevant distribution may help.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Why does rnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1) give an error?\nQuestion 3: What does map(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5) do?\nQuestion 4: Why does map_chr(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5) result in an error?\nQuestion 5: The output of map(1:5, runif) is a [vector  list] with ___ elements. The third element is a [vector / list] with ___ random draw(s) from a Uniform distribution with min = ___ and max = ___.\n\n\nSetting a Random Number Seed\nFunctions like rnorm() rely on something called pseudo-randomness. Because computers can never be truly random, complicated processes are implemented to make “random” number generation be so unpredictable as to behave like true randomness.\nThis means that projects involving simulation are harder to make reproducible. For example, here are two identical lines of code that give different results!\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.6392951\n\n\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.3586688\n\n\nFortunately, pseudo-randomness depends on a seed, which is an arbitrary number where the randomizing process starts. Normally, R will choose the seed for you, from a pre-generated vector:\n\nhead(.Random.seed)\n\n[1]       10403           4 -2144583292   740566983   934455965  -207234540\n\n\nHowever, you can also choose your own seed using the set.seed() function. This guarantees your results will be consistent across runs (and hopefully computers):\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n\nOf course, it doesn’t mean the results will be the same in every subsequent run if you forget or reset the seed in between each line of code!\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n## Calling rnorm() again without a seed \"resets\" the seed! \nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.2774292\n\n\nIt is very important to always set a seed at the beginning of a Quarto document that contains any random steps, so that your rendered results are consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote, though, that this only guarantees your rendered results will be the same if the code has not changed.\nChanging up any part of the code will re-randomize everything that comes after it!\n\n\nWhen writing up a report which includes results from a random generation process, in order to ensure reproducibility in your document, use `{r}` or `r` to include your output within your written description with inline code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility: inline code example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_rand &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nmy_rand\n\n[1] 1.084441\n\n\nUsing `r my_rand` will display the result within my text:\nMy random number is 1.0844412.\nAlternatively, you could have put the rnorm code directly into the inline text `r rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)`, but this can get messy if you have a result that requires a larger chunk of code."

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nEvidently, there has been a bit of generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. This article is an interesting discussion of the problem: it makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet.\n\nFile Systems\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is probably helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system – a way to organize data stored on a hard drive. Since data is always stored as 0’s and 1’s, it’s important to have some way to figure out what type of data is stored in a specific location, and how to interpret it.\n\n\n Stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\nFile Paths\nThat’s not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\n\n\n\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your “base folder” is known as your working directory - the place your program thinks of as home."

Make sure you know how to find this; it should NOT be saved in your Downloads!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new folder, my-stat331 should now live in your Documents folder (or wherever you save it to) and contain a my-stat331.Rproj file.

    "text": "Final grade reflection\nThis component is a self-evaluation of your performance in the class. Your goal is to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade. Please be thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.\nThis reflection will be done in the reflection_template.qmd file provided in the repository. The structure of the document is as follows:\n\nWhat grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.\nFor each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.\n\n\nSome learning targets ask for one example, some ask for two examples, and some ask for specific examples relative to particular data types.\nYour Lab assignments and Challenge problems should be a primary source of these examples, but you can also include other items. Anything that supports your argument for a grade can be submitted.\nYou must indicate where the code you provided came from, including the title of the assignment and problem number either next to the code title (e.g., xlsx\nLab 2 Question 1) or as a code comment at the top of the code chunk.\nNote, your code is not expected to run! The execute options at the top of the Quarto file are set to eval: false. Thus, you do not need to load in any packages or datasets in your reflection.\n\n\nHow did you meet that grade’s requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the course syllabus section of the syllabus. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you’ve earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you’ve met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.\nWhat else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn’t explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.\n\nPlus/minus grades: You may argue to add a “+” or “-” modifier to your grade. Generally speaking a “+” added to a letter grade means you’ve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a “-” means that you have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare minimum, or you’ve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small number of minor criteria."

You are expected to address the essay prompt(s) in each file.\n\nGrowth as a data scientist: Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the course. Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed in learning them. Don’t just give a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus, so we know them already). Focus instead on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth. Explain in this essay how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing.\nThe power of efficiency: As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term “efficiency” means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Include: What is the definition of “efficiency”? What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science? What does efficiency allow you to do? Why is efficiency important? Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some “a-ha” moments you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)\nLightning round: Answer each of the following questions with one sentence including a brief explanation.\n\nFinish the sentence with another student’s name: “If [Student] doesn’t earn an A, then nobody should, because…” Explain your choice and your reasoning.\nWhat was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.\nWhat was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.\nWhat part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.\nGive one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 that will help them be successful in learning."

It’s possible that STAT 331 has been the most challenging course on your schedule this quarter, perhaps in your entire college career so far. I want you to know that I see you, I respect your efforts, and it’s extremely fulfilling to see you respond to the challenges and grow.\nI also want to be clear that while the time and effort spent on the class are vitally important, they are not explicitly part of the grade criteria you find in the syllabus. So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, I respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class.\nYou are free to discuss your investment in time and effort in the essay questions if you like, or apart from the portfolio if that makes more sense. But when making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of your investment of time and effort. Did your efforts result in several exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made you a valuable group member."

    "section": "Questions you might have",
    "text": "Questions you might have\n\nQ: What if you disagree with our final grade reflection?\n\nA: There are two ways this might happen.\n\nYou ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports. That is, you grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you’ve provided supports this grade. If this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting.I’ll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this feedback when constructing your final portfolio. If I believe the grade you’ve proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you’ve provided, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting. I’ll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your grade request is correct, you’ll have the chance to walk me through your materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the evidence supports. I have faith that we’ll be able to come to a mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can’t, I will assign the grade that in my estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply overriding your grade determination.\nYou ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. That is, you “lowball” yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you earned, and then just inform you that I’ve done so (and why).\n\nIn my experience, the second situation happens significantly more frequently than the first.\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a limit on the number of artifacts I can include to support my grade?\n\nA: There is no strict limit, but please be selective.\nQuality, not quantity is what we are after. We do not want every assignment in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in fewer than 8 assignments with judicious selection of homework solutions and other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a massive binder of mediocre examples.\n\n\n\nQ: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone’s question on Discord?\n\nA: This isn’t filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn’t necessary.\nDetails and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness here. For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord, pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you say? Why was that comment an example of “helpful feedback”? (Do you know that it was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you’ve earned a particular grade.\n\n\n\nQ: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a “D” in the class?\n\nA: Yes, if the person is honest and there’s not enough evidence to make the case for a “C”.\nIf you’re in that situation, be honest and don’t overreach just because the consequences are significant.\n\n\n\nQ: How long should the essays be?\n\nA: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses — without going overboard and writing more than you need.\nThere is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.\n\n\n\nQ: What if you do not submit a final portfolio?\n\nA: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion.\nI will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.\nI’ll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up."

I also gave some suggestions on how to write more tidy codes like adding more spaces between \"=\" and adding more return statements after \",\" .\n\n\nBefore my discussion with Dr. Theobold, I didn’t fully understand the Developer/Coder protocol established for our team. My collaboration with my partner was largely one-sided—I often took the lead, typing out solutions and implementing my ideas without much input from them. This approach limited my partner’s opportunities to engage and grow as a developer. After our conversation, I made a conscious effort to alternate roles more consistently, ensuring we both contributed by actively listening, discussing, and sharing our ideas as Developers and Coders. This shift allowed for a more balanced and productive collaboration."

I wrote code comments in every chunk were I revised code to state what I changed and reflect on how the new code is better ensuring to focus on the “bigger picture.” This was sometimes challenging as most of my growing areas were small fixes, but I still made sure to reflect. Overall, fixing all my growing areas and reflecting on them was very valuable because it helped me remember to incorporate those changes into the following labs. In my portfolio, I revised code chunks to reflect the changes growing and success comments suggested."

Essentially, gathering what I learned from class and critically thinking as I apply it to my assignments. Also, if I was curious or wanted to learn more, I would Google to discover new information (e.g. finding new color palettes and themes). In the code examples in my portfolio, I made sure to consider all the growing and success comments on my assignments, improving my code to be tidy and efficient.

    "text": "Peer Support & Collaboration\n\nHere is my peer review from Lab 3. I particularly like this one, even though I have done a peer review every week. For this review, I talked about specific questions and gave advice on how the code can be made better. I made sure to comment what was good about the code too!\n“Hey! Good job on adding a table of contents and code folding options. This makes your overall lab have a cleaner look and easier to follow.\nIn question 7, you add some extra spacing and indenting that is unnecessary and makes the code look a little messy. Also, you can be more specific when using if_any(). For example, try adding named arguments and correct function syntax. if_any(.cols = everything(), .fns = ~ is.na(.x)).\nFor questions 10-12, you have some extra spacing and indentation that made it hard to read / follow the code. Also, you repeat the main chunk of the code twice, I think you could have combined these to get the min / max from one code chunk to be more efficient. I also couldn’t see the output of your code in most of these.\nOverall, your results seem great! Make sure to not repeat big chunks of code, always display the output, and remove extra spacing/ indents.”\n\nDuring pair programming I made sure to follow the programmer vs coder routines. When it was my partners turn to type, I would tell them what to write. When it would be my turn to type, I listened to my partner and made sure to not just type what I wanted to. If we were stuck and neither of us knew what to do, we would collaborate and try to problem solve together. I also raised my hand when needed to help my partner and I when we couldn’t figure out what to do."

You should keep this line of code and pipe into the rest of your data manipulations.\nYou will learn about the str_remove() function from the stringr package next week!\n\n\n5. Let’s consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018 (plus a column for region). The cells should contain the median() of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the region and the study_year. Order the rows by 2018 values from highest income to lowest income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions!\n\n\n6. Which California region had the lowest median full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this region correspond to the region with the lowest median income in 2018 that you found in Q4?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.\n\n\n7. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions.\nA point on the plot represents one county and year.\nYou should use a forcats function to reorder the legend automatically (not by hand).\nTry setting aspect.ratio = 1 in theme() if your plot is squished.\nIf you need more colors than what a color palette has by default, you can use the colorRampPalette() function to get more colors.\nAgain, your plot does not need to look exactly like this one!!!\nRemember to avoid “object junk” in your environment!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot to recreate"

Create side-by-side boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight (y-axis) within each species (x-axis).\nA fundamental complaint of boxplots is that they do not plot the raw data. However, with ggplot we can add the raw data points on top of the boxplots!\n11. Add another layer to your previous plot that plots each observation.\n\nAlright, this should look less than optimal. Your points should appear rather stacked on top of each other. To make them less stacked, we need to jitter them a bit, using geom_jitter().\n12. Remove the previous layer and include a geom_jitter() layer instead.\n\nThat should look a bit better! But its really hard to see the points when everything is black.\n13. Set the color aesthetic in geom_jitter() to change the color of the points and add set the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to use whatever color you wish! Some of my favorites are \"orange3\" and \"steelblue\".\n\n\nGreat! Now that you can see the points, you should notice something odd: there are two colors of points still being plotted. Some of the observations are being plotted twice, once from geom_boxplot() as outliers and again from geom_jitter()!\n14. Inspect the help file for geom_boxplot() and see how you can remove the outliers from being plotted by geom_boxplot(). Make this change in your code!\n\nSome small changes can make big differences to plots. One of these changes are better labels for a plot’s axes and legend.\n15. Modify the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to describe what is being plotted. Be sure to include any necessary units! You might also be getting overlap in the species names – use theme(axis.text.x = ____) or theme(axis.text.y = ____) to turn the species axis labels 45 degrees.\n\nSome people (and journals) prefer for boxplots to be stacked with a specific orientation! Let’s practice changing the orientation of our boxplots.\n16. Now copy-paste your boxplot code you’ve been adding to above. Flip the orientation of your boxplots. The variable that was mapped to the x-axis should now be included on the y-axis and visa versa.\nNotice how vertically stacked boxplots make the species labels more readable than horizontally stacked boxplots (even when the axis labels are rotated). This is good practice!"

In the practice activity, we will start by writing two helper functions which we will use later to write a function which sings the entire song.\nThis task is complex. It requires many different types of abilities. Everyone will be good at some of these abilities but nobody will be good at all of them. In order to produce the best product possible, you will need to use the skills of each member of your group."

The jewels were stolen and replaced with fakes, but detectives have not been able to solve the case. They are now calling in a data scientist to help parse their clues.\nA camera was located near the building where the jewels went missing, so the detectives have provided you with a list of people who may have entered the building. This list includes the date and time they were spotted on the camera, in Pacific Standard Time (PST).\nUnfortunately, the date and time of the jewel heist is not known. You have been hired to crack the case. Use the clues below to discover the thief’s identity.\n\nsuspects &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoerehnberg/STAT331-S23/main/practice_activities/suspects.csv\")\n\ndim(suspects)\n\n[1] 214   3\n\n# 214 total suspects\n\n\n\nThe crime was committed in Montecito, CA, so we need to make sure the time zone for these dates are correct. Modify the Time.Spotted variable to have the correct time zone.\n\n\nBased on the cleaning schedule for the room where the jewels are held, the heist was not committed in the morning.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 112 suspects left\n\n\n\nThe room where the heist was committed is closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays (and there were no signs of forced entry), so the heist did not happen on those days.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 78 suspects left\n\n\nIt is believed that the heist was committed within 5 weeks (35 days) of Thanksgiving 2022. Hint: Pay attention to time zones!\n\n\n# After this step you should have 11 suspects left\n\n\n\nThe detectives partially decoded a message from the thief to a notorious fence in Iceland. In it, the thief said the job would be done “after the sun sets for you, but before midnight.” Hint: When does the sun set in Iceland at that time of year?\n\n\n# After this step you should have 4 suspects left\n\n\nThe thief left behind a receipt at the scene of the crime. The receipt is smudged, but the day of the month is shown to be 22. It is thought that the heist took place no more than three days after the receipt was issued.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 2 suspects left\n\n\n\nThe thief is amused by your efforts and has sent you a cryptic clue:\n\n\n“The exact number of seconds between midnight on Jan 1, 1970 and the time I arrived on the scene is divisible by 6.”\n\n\n# You should end with 1 suspect left"

Write your own code to complete the steps, in the order given below.\n\nAdd 14 to every number.\nMultiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.\nUse the exp() function to exponentiate every number.\nSquare every number.\n\nHint: To update a vector after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with its updated counterpart. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x.\n\n## Code to carry out steps 6-9 \n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 352 numbers in the secret message that are below 17. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it “evens”. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Code to carry out steps 10-15\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\nHint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\n# Code for steps 16-18\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector"

    "text": "3.1 Revisions\nThe grading system for this class encourages you to submit revisions on Lab and Challenge problems you were not initially successful with. When I grade your Lab and Challenge assignments, I will mark each problem with an S, a G, or an N. You will have the option to retry any Learning Targets for which you scored a G or an N on. When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—I need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nIf your revisions do not include reflections by the deadline, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from my STAT 313 course, but I think you’ll get the idea.\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.\n\nIt is my goal to have your lab and challenge assignments (which are due on Monday at 5pm) back to you no later than Thursday, so we can spend time talking about the revisions during class. You will then have until the following Friday to complete your revisions on the problems you received a G or an N on.\n\n\n\nNote that I have chosen this deadline because I’m juggling two competing desires, (1) to step away from my email on the weekend, and (2) to make sure people’s questions get answered before the assignment is due.↩︎"

You will often have the choice of what direction you would like to expand your knowledge. There are no specific requirements for how you extend your skills, only that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\n\n\nRevise Your Thinking\nFor the problems in each Lab Assignment, I will give copious written feedback, but I’ll also summarize my feedback with a letter on the SGN scale (as discussed previously).

    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two “roles”—Developer and Coder. We will discuss these roles in class, but you can find descriptions of the scope of each role on the Pair Programming Roles document.\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else’s code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing “tidy” and “efficient” code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone’s code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other."

During the first few weeks of class, we’ll work together to create a set of norms that will govern our interactions with each other, to ensure that we’re always respectful of everyone.\nSo that everyone feels comfortable participating, every member of this class must show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom.

I really appreciate your use of whitespace and returns to break up your code and make it more readable. The main suggestion I have is to pay attention to how many times you are calling the same function during your data wrangling process. For example, in your code you use the filter() function three times. Could you do all this filtering in one call to the filter() function? That would help make your code more efficient!”"

The goal of this exercise is to put these pieces together in such a way that each member of your group ends up with a complete circle. However, there are a few additional rules to keep things fun:\n\nThis exercise must be done in complete silence. No talking is permitted.\nYou may not point or signal to other players with your hands in any way.\nEach player must put together their own circle. No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces—one at a time—to any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you. As per the previous rule, you may not place a piece in another person’s puzzle; players must complete their own puzzle. Instead, you are expected to hand the piece to the other player."

The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database is an open source data set containing time series on the military spending of countries from 1949–2019. The database is updated annually, which may include updates to data from previous years.\nMilitary expenditure is presented in many ways:\n\nin local currency and in US $ (both from 2018 and current);\nin terms of financial years and calendar years;\nas a share of GDP and per capita.\n\nThe availability of data varies considerably by country, but we note that data is available from at least the late 1950s for a majority of countries that were independent at the time. Estimates for regional military expenditure have been extended backwards depending on availability of data, but no estimates for total world military expenditure are available before 1988 due to the lack of data from the Soviet Union.\nSIPRI military expenditure data is based on open sources only."

Our desired plot looks something like this:\n\n\n\nDesired plot: Countries from Central Asia used for demonstration – your plot will have different countries and spending values.\n\n\nUnfortunately, if we want a point representing the spending for every country and year, we need every year to be a single column!\nTo tidy a dataset like this, we need to pivot the columns of years from wide format to long format. To do this process we need three arguments:\n\ncols: The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In these data, those are all the columns from 1988 to 2019.\nnames_to: The name of the variable that should be created to move these columns into. In these data, this could be \"Year\".\nvalues_to: The name of the variable that should be created to move these column’s values into. In these data, this could be labeled \"Spending\".\n\nThese form the three required arguments for the pivot_longer() function.\n6. Pivot the cleaned up military data set to a “longer” orientation. Save this new “long” version as a new object called military_long.\nHint: Do not overwrite your cleaned up dataset!"

The designer is then tasked with instructing the players how to replicate the design they created, but there are some rules.\n\nThe designer cannot touch the players shapes.\nThe designer cannot tell the players how to assemble the shapes into the correct design.\nThe designer can respond to questions posed by the players.\n\n\n\nPlayers\n“Players” are tasked with solving the design made by the “designer.” Players can pose questions to the designer to uncover their design. Once an player believes they have figured out the design, the designer should check their solution. If the designer says the solution is correct, then the player can assist the designer in answering questions posed by the other players.\n\n\nObserver\nThe “observer” is tasked with monitoring the interactions between the designer and the players. Specifically, the observer should check off the number of times they see two behaviors occurring, (1) explaining by telling how, and (2) everybody helps. The observer should have a scoring sheet to tally the number of times they see each behavior."

I really appreciated the context they infused into their hypothesis test conclusion!\nBased on the results of the Chi-Squared test of Independence, we have a p-value of 0.006075 and a X^2 value of 10.207. Since the p-value is less than α = 0.05, we reject the null hypotheses indicating a statistically significant association between seniority level and SET evaluation results. This suggests that instructor experience across junior, senior, and very senior appears to influence how students perceive the use of engaging activities in class.\nBecause the p-value of our Chi-squared test of independence is less than 0.05 (0.006075), we know that there is an association between a teachers seniority and their SET scores from question 3 on if the professor used activities to make the class more engaging. Combining this Chi-squared test with the graph, we can see that more experienced teachers do a better job of implementing engaging activities is their classes."

I’ve added the hex colors for the islands to the subtitle of my plot:\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = island)\n       ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = untitled_red) +\n  labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\", \n       y = \"\", \n       title = \"Length of Different Penguin Species' Bills\", \n       subtitle = \"Separated by &lt;span style='color: #c8251d;'&gt;Biscoe&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:  #a11b26;'&gt;Dream&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style='color: #ef6552;'&gt;Torgenson&lt;/span&gt; Islands\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\", \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the subtitle is still specified as a string. Inside the string there are HTML elements (&lt;span&gt;) that declare the colors of the text. For example, &lt;span style='color: #c8251d;'&gt;Biscoe&lt;/span&gt; declares that the text “Biscoe” should be printed with the color #c8251d. The beginning of the span (&lt;span) and the end of the span (&lt;/span&gt;) declare when the coloring starts and ends.\n\nFor this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created in Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable sex. Next, you need to move the legend colors for each level of sex into the plot title or subtitle. Finally, you are expected to use the theme() function to remove the color legend from the plot, since it is no longer needed!"

You will need to link directly to the image (with image file extension) - right click on your uploaded image and choose ‘copy image address’ to get the proper link.\nCan you think of another way to solve FizzBuzz using a different logical structure? What do you need to know how to do in R for each solution? Do you need to know how to concatenate strings? Convert something from an integer to a string? Just output stuff? Thinking through these requirements can help you decide which solution is the simplest and/or best.\nList out the requirements of the solution in your program flow map here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the R chunk below, write code which will solve this problem using a for loop that goes from 1 to 30.\n\n# Write your code here.\n\nEach logical comparison can take some time to evaluate. How many logical comparisons are evaluated in your for loop? Can you count them up? For instance, if your if-elseif-else statement is TRUE on the first if statement, then the second logical comparison is not evaluated, but if it is FALSE for the first comparison, then the second comparison does get evaluated. Thinking about efficiency is one way to evaluate whether code is well-written or not.\nNumber of logical comparisons:\n\n\n\nCan you use string concatenation to produce a solution that has only 3 single if statements (that is, one that doesn’t use nested if statements or an if-else construction)? This may be different from the way you constructed your solution, and that’s good - there are many ways to solve this problem.\n\n# Write your code here."

There are SET surveys from students in all fields and all levels of study offered by the university. 1\nThe SET questionnaire that every student at this university completes is as follows:\n\nEvaluation survey of the teaching staff of University of Poland. Please complete the following evaluation form, which aims to assess the lecturer’s performance. Only one answer should be indicated for each question. The answers are coded in the following way:\n5: I strongly agree\n4: I agree\n3: Neutral\n2: I don’t agree\n1: I strongly don’t agree\nQuestion 1: I learned a lot during the course.\nQuestion 2: I think that the knowledge acquired during the course is very useful.\nQuestion 3: The professor used activities to make the class more engaging.\nQuestion 4: If it was possible, I would enroll for a course conducted by this lecturer again.\nQuestion 5: The classes started on time.\nQuestion 6: The lecturer always used time efficiently.\nQuestion 7: The lecturer delivered the class content in an understandable and efficient way.\nQuestion 8: The lecturer was available when we had doubts.\nQuestion 9. The lecturer treated all students equally regardless of their race, background and ethnicity.\n\nThese data are from the end of the winter semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. In the period of data collection, all university classes were entirely online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While expected learning outcomes were not changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could have implications for data.\nAverage SET scores were combined with many other variables, including:\n\ncharacteristics of the teacher (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in the past 6 semesters).\ncharacteristics of the course (time of day, day of the week, course type, course breadth, class duration, class size).\npercentage of students providing SET feedback.\ncourse grades (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the current course and previous six semesters).\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new hypotheses.\nBefore tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable in the data dictionary here. You will want to have this open and refer back to it!\n1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis. Hint: The ggplot2 package and the readr package can both be loaded with the tidyverse package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: packages\n# Code to load in packages necessary for the analysis\n```\n\n2.

Provide a brief overview (~4 sentences) of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to start an analysis by getting a feel for the data and providing a quick summary for readers. You do not need to show any code for this question, although you probably want to use code to get some information about the data (e.g., summary(data), glimpse(data), dim(data), etc.). Things you should think about:\n– where did the data come from? - what is the context of the data? - how much data do you have? - what sort of data (e.g., variables, data type)?\n\n\n4.

How many unique instructors and unique courses are present in the cleaned dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: summarize(), n_distinct()\n\n\n7. What are the demographics of the instructors in this study?

The interpretation that a lot of textbooks include is somthing like “if we were to repeat the study many many times, 95% of the confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter.”\nWe are going to implement a simulation that illustrates this statistical concept using confidence intervals for the slope parameter in a linear regression model.\nLet’s break it down into a couple of steps.\nAs a reminder, the typical population model that we assume for a linear regression is:\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\varepsilon\\] Where \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the population intercept and slope parameters and and \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) is random noise that is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nWe will design a simulation that uses this “data generating model.”\n4. Fill in the code below to generate a synthetic dataset with 100 observations. We will assume that the explanatory variable \\(X\\) is uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 and that \\(\\sigma^2\\) = 1. The synthetic data should be a dataframe with 100 rows and two columns: x and y.\n\n# define slope and intercept parameters\nintercept = 2\nslope = 1\n\n# generate x vector\n\n\n# generate noise `ep` vector\n\n\n# generate outcome from population model\ny = intercept + x*slope + ep\n\n\n# create an \"observed data\" dataframe with only the x and y vectors\n\n5. Fit a simple linear regression model of the outcome y on x. Use tidy() from the broom package to extract a dataframe from the lm() output that includes the slope estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the slope estimate.\n\n# Q5 code\n\n6. Check whether the true population slope is inside of the estimated 95% confidence interval for that simulated dataset. Specifically, add a variable called cover to the dataframe of estimates you created in the last question (Q5) that is 1 if the population slope is in the interval and 0 if not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, we set slope = 1 in the data generation (Q4) so the true population slope is \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\).\n\n\n\n# Q6 code\n\n7. Now put this all together into a function called mycifun! Run the check provided to ensure that it works correctly\n\nThe function should have three required arguments: beta0, beta1, and n (the number of observations in the simulated data).\nThe function should complete the steps in Q4-6 given these arguments:\n\ngenerate one synthetic dataset based on the data generating model as above\nfit a linear regression model\ncheck that the population slope is contained in the estimated 95% confidence interval for the sample slope\n\nThe output of the function should be a dataframe/tibble with one row and four columns: the slope estimate, lower bound of the CI, upper bound of the CI, and whether the population slope is within the CI.\n\n\n# Q7 code\n\n\nmycifun(beta0 = 1, beta1 = 2, n = 1000)\n\n8a. Now run this simulation 1,000 times using map_dfr() and the function you wrote (mycifun()). Generate data with \\(\\beta_0 = 3\\), \\(\\beta_1 = .5\\) and \\(n = 100\\).

What does one row in the resulting ci_dat represent?\n8c. What is your simulated coverage rate? In otherwords, for what proportion of the iterations was the population slope within the estimated 95% confidence interval? Write your answer as a sentence in Markdown using inline code!\n9. Create a visualization to illustrate the coverage rate.\nYou can create any visualization that effectively illustrates the concept. I included a plot below with my idea of an effective plot to illustrate the concept of coverage. Actually, a professor showed me a plot like this in undergrad and I have always remembered it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou do not need to exactly copy the plot, even if you choose to do something like it. A couple of hints to get you started on making a plot like this one:\n\nCheck out geom_errorbar()\nCheck out geom_vline() for the line indicating the true population slope\nSee this slide for code from Dr. Theobold to include colors in a title rather than a legend.\nI took a random sample of 100 simulations to make it easier to look at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Plot\n\n\n\n# Q9 code"

There were a couple instances where you could have made some returns after commas, but for the most part you did very well. Additionally, I appreciate you sizing down the text size on the x-axis of your graph, I will definitely be adding that to my revisions!\nOne thing that you might be able to do better is in question 3, instead of using case_when(), you could use fct_collapse() in order to collapse the counties into region groups. This way you don’t have to repetitively type “county_name %in%”. Furthermore, this change would save you some time in writing your code for question 6 (the graph), as your region factors will already be in place.\nAgain, great job on lab 4!”\n\nI think when it came to working in a pair on practice activities, I never really had any large issues. I was always trying to be conscious of the coder and developer roles and follow the directions as best as possible. I think where I improved was in my advice as the developer to the coder. I became better at explaining my thought processes and explaining how I knew something made sense a certain way. This allowed me and my partner to be much more efficient with our practice activities and gave us more time to learn what was going on in the R code."

You will collaborate with your team to solve a puzzle, requiring that you accomplish a series of tasks, each of which applies the statistical computing concepts from that week. The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost.\nThe course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the activity.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nDue Mondays at 5pm\nAfter class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you’ve learned. If you got something wrong, don’t worry! You’ll have a chance to try again.\nLabs will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Lab Assignments will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment.\n\n\nChallenges\nDue Mondays at 5pm\nEach Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem, which asks you to extend the skills you’ve learned in class in some way. Frequently, you have the choice of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\nAlthough you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text absolutely must be your own.\nChallenges will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Challenges will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment."

Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click “Ok” until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you’re going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup."

Often you will specify a relative file path to your data set rather than an absolute file path. This works if the file is in the same directory as the code or within a sub-folder of the same directory as the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative file paths\n\n\n\n\n# this will work if the file is in the same directory as the code\n# (i.e., the Quarto document and the data are in the same folder)\nsurveys &lt;- read_csv(file = \"surveys.csv\")\n\n# this will work if a sub-folder called \"data\" is in the same directory as the code\n# (i.e., you first have to enter the data sub folder and then you can access the surveys.csv data set)\nsurveys &lt;- read_csv(file = \"data/surveys.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy opinion\n\n\n\nI often organize my workflow with sub-folders so that I would have a sub-folder called data to reference from my base directory location.\nYou can either choose to create an overall data sub-folder right within your STAT 331 folder (e.g., STAT 331 &gt; data) and store all of your data for your class there… or you may choose to store the data associated with each individual assignment within that folder (e.g., STAT 331 &gt; labs &gt; lab2 &gt; data).\n\n\nBut wait! I thought we created our R Projects (STAT 331.Rproj) to indicate our “home base” directory? When working with a Quarto document, this changes your base directory (for any code running within the .qmd file) to the same folder the .qmd file lives in.\nOpen your class directory STAT 331.Rproj and type getwd() into the Console. This should lead you to the folder directory your R Project was created in.\nNow open your lab1.qmd assignment and type getwd() into a code chunk. This should lead you to the folder directory your lab1.qmd file is saved in.\nUgh, that’s confusing."

Suppose I’m working on lab2.qmd, which is stored in the Lab 2 subfolder of Week 2. For my assignment I need to read in the surveys.csv data file, which is also stored in the Lab 2 folder.\nThis is how my path would look:\n\nsurveys &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"Week 2\", \"Lab 2\", \"surveys.csv\"))\n\nNote the folder and file names are in quotations because they are names of files and not objects in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Functions without Loading a Package\n\n\n\nUsing :: before the function (e.g., here::here) is a way of telling R which package the function lives in without having to load that entire package (e.g., library(here)).\nThe choice of loading an entire packageversus accessing a function from a package comes down to efficiency. If you are only using one function from a package, then it seems inefficient to load the entire package which would take up much more memory. This is the case for the here package, where we will be using one function (the here() function) from this package."

    "text": "2.1 Pivot Operations\nIt’s fairly common for data to come in forms which are convenient for either human viewing or data entry. Unfortunately, these forms aren’t necessarily the most friendly for analysis. There are two main “layouts” a dataset can have:\n\n“wide” format\n“long” format\n\nThe image below shows the same dataset presented in each layout.\n\nSometimes we will be given data that is in one layout and we will need to transform it into a different layout. This animation illustrates the process of going from a wide data layout to a long data layout, and how to go from a long data layout back to a wide data layout. Here, we are using the pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() functions from the tidyr package in R.\n\n\n\n© Kelsey Gonzales\n\n\nLet’s explore each of these formats in more depth\n\n2.1.1 Longer\n📖 Required Reading: R4DS Section 5.3 (Lengthening data)\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the data come in what we might call “wide” form - some of the column names are not names of variables (e.g., year), but instead, are themselves values of another variable (e.g., 1991, 1992).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that I’m surrounding 1999 in back ticks (` `). I need to do this because a number is not a syntactically correct variable name, so using cols = 1999:2000 would not work!\n\n\nPicture the Operationpivot_longer()\n\n\nTables 4a and 4b (from above) are good examples of data which is in “wide” form and should be transformed into a long(er) form. The values of year are spread across multiple columns.\n\ntable4a\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  country     `1999` `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan    745   2666\n2 Brazil       37737  80488\n3 China       212258 213766\n\ntable4b\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  country         `1999`     `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan   19987071   20595360\n2 Brazil       172006362  174504898\n3 China       1272915272 1280428583\n\n\nThe solution to this is to rearrange the data into “long form”: to take the columns which contain values and “stack” them, adding a variable to indicate which column each value came from. To do this, we have to duplicate the values in any column which isn’t being stacked (e.g. country, in both the example above and the image below).\n\n\n\nA visual representation of what the pivot_longer operation looks like in practice.\n\n\nOnce our data are in long form, we can (if necessary) separate values that once served as column labels into actual variables, and we’ll have tidy(er) data.\n\n\n\n\ntable4a |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = `1999`:`2000`, \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"cases\"\n               )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country     year   cases\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan 1999     745\n2 Afghanistan 2000    2666\n3 Brazil      1999   37737\n4 Brazil      2000   80488\n5 China       1999  212258\n6 China       2000  213766\n\ntable4b |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -country, \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"population\"\n               )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country     year  population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan 1999    19987071\n2 Afghanistan 2000    20595360\n3 Brazil      1999   172006362\n4 Brazil      2000   174504898\n5 China       1999  1272915272\n6 China       2000  1280428583\n\n\nThe columns are moved to a variable with the name passed to the argument names_to (hopefully, that is easy to remember), and the values are moved to a variable with the name passed to the argument values_to (again, hopefully easy to remember).\nWe identify ID variables (variables which we don’t want to pivot) by not including them in the pivot statement. We can do this in one of two ways:\n\nselect only variables (columns) we want to pivot (e.g., cols = `1999`:`2000`)\nselect variables (columns) we don’t want to pivot, using - to remove them (e.g., cols = -country).\n\nWhich option is easier depends how many things you’re pivoting (and how the columns are structured).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Wider\n📖 Required Reading: R4DS Section 5.3 (Widening data)\n\n\n\nWhile it’s very common to need to transform data into a longer format, it’s not that uncommon to need to do the reverse operation. When an observation is scattered across multiple rows, your data is too long and needs to be made wider again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that I’m not using a cols argument for pivot_wider()! This is because pivot_wider() only modifies the columns specified in the names_from and values_from arguments.\n\n\nPicture the Operationpivot_wider()\n\n\nTable 2 (from above) is an example of a table that is in long format but needs to be converted to a wider layout to be “tidy” - there are separate rows for cases and population, which means that a single observation (one year, one country) has two rows.\n\ntable2\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n   country      year type            count\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan  1999 cases             745\n 2 Afghanistan  1999 population   19987071\n 3 Afghanistan  2000 cases            2666\n 4 Afghanistan  2000 population   20595360\n 5 Brazil       1999 cases           37737\n 6 Brazil       1999 population  172006362\n 7 Brazil       2000 cases           80488\n 8 Brazil       2000 population  174504898\n 9 China        1999 cases          212258\n10 China        1999 population 1272915272\n11 China        2000 cases          213766\n12 China        2000 population 1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual representation of what the pivot_wider operation looks like in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable2 |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from  = type, \n              values_from = count\n              )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  country      year  cases population\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071\n2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360\n3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362\n4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898\n5 China        1999 212258 1272915272\n6 China        2000 213766 1280428583"

    "text": "1.1 Regular Expressions\n\nSome people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawinski\n\nRegular expressions (or regex) is a concise and powerful language created to describe patterns in strings. You can think of regular expressions as an advanced versions of “Find” in a text editor, helping you search for specific patterns in strings. These expressions use symbols to define flexible search patterns. For example, the symbol . is used to match any character (letter, number, punctuation) and the symbol \\d is used to match any digit.\nWe’re going to learn a little bit more about regular expressions and how you can use them to search for specific patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA cheatsheet on regular expressions is included in Week 5 of your coursepack! If you do not have a coursepack I would strongly recommending printing the regular expression cheatsheet.\n\n\n\n📖 Recommended Reading: R4DS Chapter 15 (Regular Expressions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead at least through Section 15.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is Dr. T’s short primer on regular expressions\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this web app built to test R regular expressions. The subset of regular expression syntax we’re going to cover here is fairly limited, but you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related. As with any tool, there are situations where it’s useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.\nHere are the basics of regular expressions:\n\n[] enclose sets of characters\n\nFor example, [abc] will match any single character a, b, c\n\n- specifies a range of characters\n\nFor example, A-z will match all upper and lower case letters (A-Z, and then a-z)\n\n. matches any character (except a newline)\nTo match special characters, you need to escape them using a \\ (in most languages) or \\\\ (in R).\n\nFor example, a \\. or \\\\. will match a literal ., \\$ or \\\\$ will match a literal $.\n\n\n\nnum_string &lt;- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\nstr_extract(num_string, \n            pattern = \"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\")\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n\n\nRepeating Patterns\nListing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?\n\n* means repeat between 0 and inf times\n+ means 1 or more times\n? means 0 or 1 times – most useful when you’re looking for something optional\n{a, b} means repeat between a and b times, where a and b are integers.\n\nNote that b can be blank. So [abc]{3,} will match abc, aaaa, cbbaa, but not ab, bb, or a.\n\n{a} specifies an exact number of repeated charaters.\n\nFor example, {3} means “exactly 3 times” whereas {3,} means “3 or more times.”\n\n\n\nnum_string\n\n[1] \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *two* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by a dash.\nstr_extract(num_string, pattern = \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\")\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by any character, \nstr_extract(num_string, pattern = \"[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}\")\n\n[1] \"123-456-7890\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of at least *eight* numbers \nstr_extract(num_string, pattern = \"[0-9]{8,}\")\n\n[1] \"12345678\"\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring\nThere are also ways to “anchor” a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the beginning or the end)\n\n^ has multiple meanings:\n\nIf ^ is the first character in a pattern (e.g., ^Al) it matches the beginning of a string.\nIf ^ follows a [ (e.g., [^abc]) then it means “not.” So, [^abc] means “the collection of all characters that are not a, b, or c.”\n\n$ means the end of a string (e.g., bold$)\n\nCombined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.\n\naddress &lt;- \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500\"\n\nGrabbing the house number\n\n# Match a sequence of one or more digits at the beginning of the string\nhouse_num &lt;- str_extract(address, pattern = \"^[0-9]{1,}\")\nhouse_num\n\n[1] \"1600\"\n\n\nGrabbing the street\n\n# Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma\nstreet &lt;- str_extract(address, pattern = \"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}\")\nstreet\n\n[1] \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\"\n\n# Remove house number from street address\nstreet &lt;- str_remove(street, house_num) |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim() \nstreet\n\n[1] \"Pennsylvania Ave NW\"\n\n\nGrabbing the city\n\n# Match one or more characters between the two commas  \ncity &lt;- str_extract(address, pattern = \",.{1,},\") |&gt; \n  # Remove the leading and trailing commas\n  str_remove_all(\",\") |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim()\ncity\n\n[1] \"Washington D.C.\"\n\n\nGrabbing the zip code\n\n# Matches both 5 and 9 digit zip codes found at the end of the string\nzip &lt;- str_extract(address, pattern = \"[0-9]{5,10}$\") \nzip\n\n[1] \"20500\"\n\n\n\n\nMaking Groups\n\n() are used to capture information\n\nFor example, ([0-9]{4}) captures any 4-digit number\n\nan | means “or”\n\nFor example, a|b will select a or b.\n\n\nMaking a group of characters\n\nfruit\n\n [1] \"apple\"             \"apricot\"           \"avocado\"          \n [4] \"banana\"            \"bell pepper\"       \"bilberry\"         \n [7] \"blackberry\"        \"blackcurrant\"      \"blood orange\"     \n[10] \"blueberry\"         \"boysenberry\"       \"breadfruit\"       \n[13] \"canary melon\"      \"cantaloupe\"        \"cherimoya\"        \n[16] \"cherry\"            \"chili pepper\"      \"clementine\"       \n[19] \"cloudberry\"        \"coconut\"           \"cranberry\"        \n[22] \"cucumber\"          \"currant\"           \"damson\"           \n[25] \"date\"              \"dragonfruit\"       \"durian\"           \n[28] \"eggplant\"          \"elderberry\"        \"feijoa\"           \n[31] \"fig\"               \"goji berry\"        \"gooseberry\"       \n[34] \"grape\"             \"grapefruit\"        \"guava\"            \n[37] \"honeydew\"          \"huckleberry\"       \"jackfruit\"        \n[40] \"jambul\"            \"jujube\"            \"kiwi fruit\"       \n[43] \"kumquat\"           \"lemon\"             \"lime\"             \n[46] \"loquat\"            \"lychee\"            \"mandarine\"        \n[49] \"mango\"             \"mulberry\"          \"nectarine\"        \n[52] \"nut\"               \"olive\"             \"orange\"           \n[55] \"pamelo\"            \"papaya\"            \"passionfruit\"     \n[58] \"peach\"             \"pear\"              \"persimmon\"        \n[61] \"physalis\"          \"pineapple\"         \"plum\"             \n[64] \"pomegranate\"       \"pomelo\"            \"purple mangosteen\"\n[67] \"quince\"            \"raisin\"            \"rambutan\"         \n[70] \"raspberry\"         \"redcurrant\"        \"rock melon\"       \n[73] \"salal berry\"       \"satsuma\"           \"star fruit\"       \n[76] \"strawberry\"        \"tamarillo\"         \"tangerine\"        \n[79] \"ugli fruit\"        \"watermelon\"       \n\n# Searches for fruits containing a group of two p's (need to be together)\nstr_view(fruit, pattern = \"(pp)\")\n\n [1] │ a&lt;pp&gt;le\n [5] │ bell pe&lt;pp&gt;er\n[17] │ chili pe&lt;pp&gt;er\n[62] │ pinea&lt;pp&gt;le\n\n\nUsing an “or”\n\n# Searches for fruits containing apple OR melon OR nut\nstr_view(fruit, pattern = \"apple|melon|nut\")\n\n [1] │ &lt;apple&gt;\n[13] │ canary &lt;melon&gt;\n[20] │ coco&lt;nut&gt;\n[52] │ &lt;nut&gt;\n[62] │ pine&lt;apple&gt;\n[72] │ rock &lt;melon&gt;\n[80] │ water&lt;melon&gt;\n\n\nReferencing groups\n\n# Searches for fruits where there are two characters (..) that get repeated\n# a second time \\\\1\nstr_view(fruit, pattern = \"(..)\\\\1\")\n\n [4] │ b&lt;anan&gt;a\n[20] │ &lt;coco&gt;nut\n[22] │ &lt;cucu&gt;mber\n[41] │ &lt;juju&gt;be\n[56] │ &lt;papa&gt;ya\n[73] │ s&lt;alal&gt;

    "text": "1.1 Tidy Evaluation\nWriting functions that work with data frames and call on the functions we’ve become used to (e.g., filter(), select(), summarise()) requires we learn about tidy evaluation. To write these functions you will need to know, at a high level, whether the function you are trying to incorporate uses data masking or tidy selection.\nAt a high level, data masking is used in functions like arrange(), filter(), and summarize() that compute with variables. Whereas, tidy selection is used for functions like select() and rename() that select variables.\nYour intuition about which functions use tidy evaluation should be good for many of these functions. If you can input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function (e.g., select(mtcars, c(vs, am, gear))), then the function uses tidy selection! If you cannot input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function, then the function is performing computations on the data and uses data masking.\nIf you are interested in learning more about tidy evaluation, I would highly recommend:\n\nthis video by Jenny Bryan\n\nI do want to note that this video is from 2019 and some things have changed since then.

    "text": "Simulating Coverage\nMany students struggle with the definition of a confidence interval when first learning the concept. The interpretation that a lot of textbooks include is somthing like “if we were to repeat the study many many times, 95% of the confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter.”\nWe are going to implement a simulation that illustrates this statistical concept using confidence intervals for the slope parameter in a linear regression model.\nLet’s break it down into a couple of steps.\nAs a reminder, the typical population model that we assume for a linear regression is:\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\varepsilon\\] Where \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the population intercept and slope parameters and and \\(\\varepsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) is random noise that is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nWe will design a simulation that uses this “data generating model.”\n4. Fill in the code below to generate a synthetic dataset with 100 observations. We will assume that the explanatory variable \\(X\\) is uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 and that \\(\\sigma^2\\) = 1. The synthetic data should be a dataframe with 100 rows and two columns: x and y.\n\n# define slope and intercept parameters\nintercept = 2\nslope = 1\n\n# generate x vector\n\n\n# generate noise `ep` vector\n\n\n# generate outcome from population model\ny = intercept + x*slope + ep\n\n\n# create an \"observed data\" dataframe with only the x and y vectors\n\n5. Fit a simple linear regression model of the outcome y on x. Use tidy() from the broom package to extract a dataframe from the lm() output that includes the slope estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the slope estimate.\n\n# Q5 code\n\n6. Check whether the true population slope is inside of the estimated 95% confidence interval for that simulated dataset. Specifically, add a variable called cover to the dataframe of estimates you created in the last question (Q5) that is 1 if the population slope is in the interval and 0 if not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, we set slope = 1 in the data generation (Q4) so the true population slope is \\(\\beta_1 = 1\\).\n\n\n\n# Q6 code\n\n7. Now put this all together into a function called mycifun! Run the check provided to ensure that it works correctly\n\nThe function should have three required arguments: beta0, beta1, and n (the number of observations in the simulated data).\nThe function should complete the steps in Q4-6 given these arguments:\n\ngenerate one synthetic dataset based on the data generating model as above\nfit a linear regression model\ncheck that the population slope is contained in the estimated 95% confidence interval for the sample slope\n\nThe output of the function should be a dataframe/tibble with one row and four columns: the slope estimate, lower bound of the CI, upper bound of the CI, and whether the population slope is within the CI.\n\n\n# Q7 code\n\n\nmycifun(beta0 = 1, beta1 = 2, n = 1000)\n\n8a. Now run this simulation 1,000 times using map_dfr() and the function you wrote (mycifun()). Generate data with \\(\\beta_0 = 3\\), \\(\\beta_1 = .5\\) and \\(n = 100\\). Make sure to add a line of code to make your simulation reproducible every time you run it.\n\nci_dat &lt;- map_dfr(.x = 1:1000,\n                  .f = \n                    )\n\n8b. What does one row in the resulting ci_dat represent?\n8c. What is your simulated coverage rate? In otherwords, for what proportion of the iterations was the population slope within the estimated 95% confidence interval? Write your answer as a sentence in Markdown using inline code!\n9. Create a visualization to illustrate the coverage rate.\nYou can create any visualization that effectively illustrates the concept. I included a plot below with my idea of an effective plot to illustrate the concept of coverage. Actually, a professor showed me a plot like this in undergrad and I have always remembered it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou do not need to exactly copy the plot, even if you choose to do something like it. A couple of hints to get you started on making a plot like this one:\n\nCheck out geom_errorbar()\nCheck out geom_vline() for the line indicating the true population slope\nSee this slide for code from Dr. Theobold to include colors in a title rather than a legend.\nI took a random sample of 100 simulations to make it easier to look at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Plot\n\n\n\n# Q9 code"
