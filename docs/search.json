    "text": "1 Simulation in R\n\nüìñ Required Reading: R Programming for Data Science : Simulation\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úÖ : Check-in 9.1: Distributions & Simulation\nQuestion 1: What does the output of pnorm(-4, mean = 2, sd = 4) mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDrawing pictures of the relevant distribution may help.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Why does rnorm(mean = 0, sd = 1) give an error?\nQuestion 3: What does map(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5) do?\nQuestion 4: Why does map_chr(-2:2, rnorm, n = 5) result in an error?\nQuestion 5: The output of map(1:5, runif) is a [vector ¬†list] with ___ elements. The third element is a [vector / list] with ___ random draw(s) from a Uniform distribution with min = ___ and max = ___.\n\n\nSetting a Random Number Seed\nFunctions like rnorm() rely on something called pseudo-randomness. Because computers can never be truly random, complicated processes are implemented to make ‚Äúrandom‚Äù number generation be so unpredictable as to behave like true randomness.\nThis means that projects involving simulation are harder to make reproducible. For example, here are two identical lines of code that give different results!\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -0.555758\n\n\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.432956\n\n\nFortunately, pseudo-randomness depends on a seed, which is an arbitrary number where the randomizing process starts. Normally, R will choose the seed for you, from a pre-generated vector:\n\nhead(.Random.seed)\n\n[1]       10403           4  -609150466  2065004984   578450843 -1994875911\n\n\nHowever, you can also choose your own seed using the set.seed() function. This guarantees your results will be consistent across runs (and hopefully computers):\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n\nOf course, it doesn‚Äôt mean the results will be the same in every subsequent run if you forget or reset the seed in between each line of code!\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -1.207066\n\n## Calling rnorm() again without a seed \"resets\" the seed! \nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.2774292\n\n\nIt is very important to always set a seed at the beginning of a Quarto document that contains any random steps, so that your rendered results are consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote, though, that this only guarantees your rendered results will be the same if the code has not changed.\nChanging up any part of the code will re-randomize everything that comes after it!\n\n\nWhen writing up a report which includes results from a random generation process, in order to ensure reproducibility in your document, use `{r}` or `r` to include your output within your written description with inline code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility: inline code example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_rand &lt;- rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nmy_rand\n\n[1] 1.084441\n\n\nUsing `r my_rand` will display the result within my text:\nMy random number is 1.0844412.\nAlternatively, you could have put the rnorm code directly into the inline text `r rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)`, but this can get messy if you have a result that requires a larger chunk of code."

What is happening inside the computer‚Äôs memory as goodpup() runs?\n\n\n\nA sketch of the execution of the program goodpup, showing that name is only defined within the local environment that is created while goodpup is running. We can never access name in our global environment.\n\n\nThis is why the distinction between arguments and parameters matters. Parameters are only accessible while inside of the function - and in that local environment, we need to call the object by the parameter name, not the name we use outside the function (the argument name).\nWe can even call a function with an argument that isn‚Äôt defined outside of the function call: goodpup(\"Tesla\") produces ‚ÄúTesla is a good pup!‚Äù. Here, I do not have a variable storing the string \"Tesla\", but I can make the function run anyways. So \"Tesla\" here is an argument to goodpup but it is not a variable in my environment.\nThis is a confusing set of concepts and it‚Äôs ok if you only just sort of get what I‚Äôm trying to explain here.

    "section": "2.4 Scope",
    "text": "2.4 Scope\nWhen talking about functions, for the first time we start to confront a critical concept in programming, which is scope. Scope is the part of the program where the name you‚Äôve given a variable is valid - that is, where you can use a variable.\n\n\n\n\nA variable is only available from inside the region it is created.\n\nWhat do I mean by the part of a program? The lexical scope is the portion of the code (the set of lines of code) where the name is valid.\nThe concept of scope is best demonstrated through a series of examples, so in the rest of this section, I‚Äôll show you some examples of how scope works and the concepts that help you figure out what ‚Äúscope‚Äù actually means in practice.\n\nName Masking\nScope is most clearly demonstrated when we use the same variable name inside and outside a function. Note that this is 1) bad programming practice, and 2) fairly easily avoided if you can make your names even slightly more creative than a, b, and so on. But, for the purposes of demonstration, I hope you‚Äôll forgive my lack of creativity in this area so that you can see how name masking works.\n\nWhat does this function return, 10 or 20?\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n\n\n\n\nA sketch of the global environment as well as the environment within myfun(). Because a = 20 inside myfun(), when we call myfun(), we get the value of a within that environment, instead of within the global environment.\n\n\n\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 20\n\na\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lexical scope of the function is the area that is between the braces. Outside the function, a has the value of 10, but inside the function, a has the value of 20. So when we call myfun(), we get 20, because the scope of myfun is the local context where a is evaluated, and the value of a in that environment dominates.\nThis is an example of name masking, where names defined inside of a function mask names defined outside of a function.\n\n\nEnvironments and Scope\nAnother principle of scoping is that if you call a function and then call the same function again, the function‚Äôs environment is re-created each time. Each function call is unrelated to the next function call when the function is defined using local variables.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if aa is not defined\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  else\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n}\n\nmyfun()\nmyfun()\n\nWhat does this output?\n\n\n{fig-alt=‚Äù The image explains how repeated calls to the myfun() function in R yield the same output because the function does not create or store an object in the global environment. The function myfun() uses an if-else statement: if the variable aa does not exist, it assigns aa the value 1; otherwise, it increments aa by 1. Each time myfun() is called, a new, independent copy of the function‚Äôs environment is created. The image depicts two separate calls to myfun(), both initializing aa to 1 because aa is not stored in either the function enviroment (where the function looks first) or in the global environment (where the function looks next) and therefore does not persist between calls. As a result, aa is always reset to 1 during each function invocation, with no accumulation occurring across different calls. The image emphasizes that the local environment created by the function is temporary and does not affect the global environment.‚Äù}\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if (!exists(\"aa\")) {\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  } else {\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n  }\n  return(aa)\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Lookup\nScoping determines where to look for values ‚Äì when, however, is determined by the sequence of steps in the code. When a function is called, the calling environment (the global environment or set of environments at the time the function is called) determines what values are used.\nIf an object doesn‚Äôt exist in the function‚Äôs environment, the global environment will be searched next; if there is no object in the global environment, the program will error out. This behavior, combined with changes in the calling environment over time, can mean that the output of a function can change based on objects outside of the function.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function(){\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\nWhat will the output be of this code?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of the global environment at the time the function is called (that is, the state of the calling environment) can change the results of the function\n\n\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 15\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the following function return?

    "text": "2.5 Debugging\nNow that you‚Äôre writing functions, it‚Äôs time to talk a bit about debugging techniques. This is a lifelong topic - as you become a more advanced programmer, you will need to develop more advanced debugging skills as well (because you‚Äôll become more adept at screwing things up).\n\n\n\nThe faces of debugging (by Allison Horst)\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the basics: print debugging.\n\nPrint Debugging\nThis technique is basically exactly what it sounds like. You insert a ton of print statements to give you an idea of what is happening at each step of the function.\nLet‚Äôs try it out on the previous example (see what I did there?)\nNote that I‚Äôve modified the code slightly so that we store the value into returnval and then return it later - this allows us to see the code execution without calling functions twice (which would make the print output a bit more confusing).\n\nf &lt;- function(x) {\n  print (\"Entering Outer Function\")\n  print (paste(\"x =\", x))\n  f &lt;- function(x) {\n    print (\"Entering Middle Function\")\n    print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n    f &lt;- function() {\n      print (\"Entering Inner Function\")\n      print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n      print (paste(\"Inner Function: Returning\", x^2))\n      x ^ 2\n    }\n    returnval &lt;- f() + 1\n    print (paste(\"Middle Function: Returning\", returnval))\n    returnval\n  }\n  returnval &lt;- f(x) * 2\n  print (paste(\"Outer Function: Returning\", returnval))\n  returnval\n}\nf(10)\n\n[1] \"Entering Outer Function\"\n[1] \"x = 10\"\n[1] \"Entering Middle Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Entering Inner Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Inner Function: Returning 100\"\n[1] \"Middle Function: Returning 101\"\n[1] \"Outer Function: Returning 202\"\n\n\n[1] 202\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Debugging Strategies\n\nDebugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. - some t-shirt I saw once\n\nThe overall process is well described in Advanced R by H. Wickham; I‚Äôve copied it here because it‚Äôs such a succinct distillation of the process, but I‚Äôve adapted some of the explanations to this class rather than the original context of package development.\n\nRealize that you have a bug\nGoogle! In R you can automate this with the errorist and searcher packages, but general Googling the error + the programming language + any packages you think are causing the issue is a good strategy.\nMake the error repeatable: This makes it easier to figure out what the error is, faster to iterate, and easier to ask for help.\n\nUse binary search (remove 1/2 of the code, see if the error occurs, if not go to the other 1/2 of the code. Repeat until you‚Äôve isolated the error.)\nGenerate the error faster - use a minimal test dataset, if possible, so that you can ask for help easily and run code faster. This is worth the investment if you‚Äôve been debugging the same error for a while.\nNote which inputs don‚Äôt generate the bug ‚Äì this negative ‚Äúdata‚Äù is helpful when asking for help.\n\nFigure out where it is. Debuggers may help with this, but you can also use the scientific method to explore the code, or the tried-and-true method of using lots of print() statements.\nFix it and test it. The goal with tests is to ensure that the same error doesn‚Äôt pop back up in a future version of your code. Generate an example that will test for the error, and add it to your documentation.\n\nThere are several other general strategies for debugging:\n\nRetype (from scratch) your code\n\nThis works well if it‚Äôs a short function or a couple of lines of code, but it‚Äôs less useful if you have a big script full of code to debug. However, it does sometimes fix really silly typos that are hard to spot, like having typed &lt;-- instead of &lt;- in R and then wondering why your answers are negative.\n\nVisualize your data as it moves through the program.\n\nThis may be done using print() statements, or the debugger, or some other strategy depending on your application.\n\nTracing statements.\n\nAgain, this is part of print() debugging, but these messages indicate progress - ‚Äúgot into function x‚Äù, ‚Äúreturning from function y‚Äù, and so on.\n\nRubber ducking.\n\nHave you ever tried to explain a problem you‚Äôre having to someone else, only to have a moment of insight and ‚Äúoh, never mind‚Äù? Hopefully so, because this is exactly how your pair programming sessions should be going! Rubber ducking outsources the problem to a nonjudgmental entity, such as a rubber duck. You simply explain, in terms simple enough for your rubber duck to understand, exactly what your code does, line by line, until you‚Äôve found the problem. A more thorough explanation can be found at gitduck.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it helpful to procure a rubber duck expert for each language you work in. I use color-your-own rubber ducks to endow my ducks with certain language expertise. Other people use plain rubber ducks and give them capes.\n\n\nDo not be surprised if, in the process of debugging, you encounter new bugs. This is a problem that‚Äôs well-known it has an xkcd comic. At some point, getting up and going for a walk may help. Redesigning your code to be more modular and more organized is also a good idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Minimal Reproducible Examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThese section is included as FYI, but you don‚Äôt have to read it just now. It;s important, but not urgent, if that makes sense.\nIf all else has failed, and you can‚Äôt figure out what is causing your error, it‚Äôs probably time to ask for help. If you have a friend or buddy that knows the language you‚Äôre working in, by all means ask for help sooner - use them as a rubber duck if you have to. But when you ask for help online, often you‚Äôre asking people who are much more knowledgeable about the topic - members of R core browse StackOverflow and may drop in and help you out. Under those circumstances, it‚Äôs better to make the task of helping you as easy as possible because it shows respect for their time. The same thing goes for your supervisors and professors. üôÉ\n\n\n\nThe reprex R package will help you make a reproducible example (drawing by Allison Horst)\n\n\nSo, with that said, there are numerous resources for writing what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúminimal working example‚Äù, ‚Äúreproducible example‚Äù (commonly abbreviated reprex), or MCVE (minimal complete verifiable example). Much of this is lifted directly from the StackOverflow post describing a minimal reproducible example.\nThe goal is to reproduce the error message with information that is\n\nminimal - as little code as possible to still reproduce the problem\ncomplete - everything necessary to reproduce the issue is contained in the description/question\nreproducible - test the code you provide to reproduce the problem.\n\nYou should format your question to make it as easy as possible to help you. Make it so that code can be copied from your post directly and pasted into an R script or notebook (e.g.¬†Quarto document code chunk). Describe what you see and what you‚Äôd hope to see if the code were working.\nOther resources:\n\nreprex package: Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts\nHow to use the reprex package - Vignette with videos from the Jenny Bryan\nreprex magic - Vignette adapted from a blog post by Nick Tierney"

There are four variables: country, year, cases, and population, but each table has a different layout.\n\nFor each of the data set, determine whether each table is tidy.\n\nIf it is not, identify which rule(s) it violates.\n\nWhat would you have to do to the data to be able to compute a standardized TB infection rate per 100,000 people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAll of these data sets are ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù to the tidyr package!\n\n\n\nTable 1Table 2Table 3Table 4Table 5\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\ncountry\nyear\ncases\npopulation\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\n745\n19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\n2666\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\n37737\n172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\n80488\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\n212258\n1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\n213766\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, each observation is a single row, each variable is a column, and everything is nicely arranged for e.g.¬†regression or statistical analysis. We can easily compute another measure, such as cases per 100,000 population, by taking cases / population * 100000 (this would define a new column).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\ncountry\nyear\ntype\ncount\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\ncases\n745\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\npopulation\n19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\ncases\n2666\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\npopulation\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\ncases\n37737\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\npopulation\n172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\ncases\n80488\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\npopulation\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\ncases\n212258\n\n\nChina\n1999\npopulation\n1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\ncases\n213766\n\n\nChina\n2000\npopulation\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have 4 columns again, but we now have 12 rows (instead of 6): one of the columns is an indicator of which of two numerical observations is recorded in that row; a second column stores the value (e.g., cases, population). This form of the data is more easily plotted in ggplot2, if we want to show trend lines for both cases and population, but computing per capita cases would be much more difficult in this form than in the arrangement in Table 1!\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\ncountry\nyear\nrate\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n1999\n745/19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n2000\n2666/20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n1999\n37737/172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n2000\n80488/174504898\n\n\nChina\n1999\n212258/1272915272\n\n\nChina\n2000\n213766/1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nThis form has only 3 columns, because the rate variable (which is a character) stores both the case count and the population. We can‚Äôt do anything with this format as it stands, because we can‚Äôt do math on data stored as characters. However, this form might be easier to read and record for a human being.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4a\n\n\ncountry\n1999\n2000\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n745\n2666\n\n\nBrazil\n37737\n80488\n\n\nChina\n212258\n213766\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4b\n\n\ncountry\n1999\n2000\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n19987071\n20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n172006362\n174504898\n\n\nChina\n1272915272\n1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this form, we have two tables - one for population, and one for cases. Each year‚Äôs observations are in a separate column. This format is often found in separate sheets of an Excel workbook. To work with this data, we‚Äôll need to transform each table so that there is a column indicating which year an observation is from, and then merge the two tables together by country and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5\n\n\ncountry\ncentury\nyear\nrate\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n19\n99\n745/19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n20\n00\n2666/20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n19\n99\n37737/172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n20\n00\n80488/174504898\n\n\nChina\n19\n99\n212258/1272915272\n\n\nChina\n20\n00\n213766/1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 is very similar to Table 3, but the year has been separated into two columns - century, and year. This is more common with year, month, and day in separate columns (or date and time in separate columns), often to deal with the fact that spreadsheets don‚Äôt always handle dates the way you‚Äôd hope they would.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, all data would come in the right format for our needs, but this is often not the case. We will spend the next few weeks learning about how to use R to reformat our data to follow the tidy data framework and see why this is so important. By the end of this chapter, you will have the skills needed to wrangle and transform the most common ‚Äúmessy‚Äù data sets into ‚Äútidy‚Äù form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we always want our data in the same layout?\n\n\n\nThe concept of tidy data is useful for mapping variables from the data set to elements in a graph, specifications of a model, or aggregating to create summaries. However, what is considered to be ‚Äútidy data‚Äù format for one task, might not be in the correct ‚Äútidy data‚Äù format for a different task. It is important for you to consider the end goal when restructuring your data.\nPart of this course is building the skills for you to be able to map your data operation steps from an original data set to the correct format (and output)."

If you are only using one function from a package, then it seems inefficient to load the entire package which would take up much more memory.

You are expected to create your own Quarto document to complete this activity.\nThe folder Age_Data contains several data sets with the names and ages of five individuals. The data sets are stored as different file types. Download Ages_Data.zip here, make sure to unzip the folder, save these in a reasonable place (e.g., STAT331 &gt; Week 2 &gt; Checkins or STAT331 &gt; Checkins &gt; Week 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting zip folders\n\n\n\nYou will need to extract the contents of the ages.zip file, that means you will need to uncompress the files from the folder for RStudio to know where to get the data from.\n\n\nOnce you have the data saved (and extracted) in your STAT 331 folder, preferably in the Week 2 subfolder, use the readr and readxl packages to complete the following exercises.\n\nLoad the appropriate packages for reading in data.\nRead in the data set ages.csv\nRead in the data set ages_tab.txt\nRead in the data set ages_mystery.txt\nRead in the data set ages.xlsx\nFind a way to use read_csv() to read ages.csv with the variable ‚ÄúName‚Äù as a factor data type and ‚ÄúAge‚Äù as a character data type.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve finished coding these exercises, head over to Canvas and fill in the ‚Äúgap‚Äù code I‚Äôve provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor reference, I would recommend you store the Ages_Data similar to how I have:"

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important‚Äîsuch as file management.\nEvidently, there has been a bit of generational shift as computers have evolved: the ‚Äúfile system‚Äù metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. This article is an interesting discussion of the problem: it makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet.\n\nFile Systems\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is probably helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system ‚Äì a way to organize data stored on a hard drive. Since data is always stored as 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs, it‚Äôs important to have some way to figure out what type of data is stored in a specific location, and how to interpret it.\n\n\n Stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\nFile Paths\nThat‚Äôs not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\n\n\n\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your ‚Äúbase folder‚Äù is known as your working directory - the place your program thinks of as home."

You can either create a new folder on your computer containing an R Project (e.g., you have not yet created a folder for this class) or you can add an R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you have already created a folder for this class).\n\nCreate with a new folderAdd to an existing folder\n\n\nTo create a R Project, first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your folder a name (it doesn‚Äôt have to be my-stat331). However, it is good practice for this file folder name to not contain spaces.\nThen, browse on your computer for a location to save this folder to. For example, mine is saved in my Documents. Make sure you know how to find this; it should NOT be saved in your Downloads!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new folder, my-stat331 should now live in your Documents folder (or wherever you save it to) and contain a my-stat331.Rproj file. This is your new ‚Äúhome‚Äù base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path it will begin to look for it here.\n\n\nTo add a R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already created a folder for this class), first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, browse on your computer to select the existing folder you wish to add your R Project to. For example, mine is saved in my Documents and called my-stat331.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour existing folder, my-stat331 should now contain a my-stat331.Rproj file. This is your new ‚Äúhome‚Äù base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path it will begin to look for it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour folder cannot synch with anything online!\n\n\n\nYour STAT 331 folder cannot be in a folder stored on OneDrive or iCloud! Storing your folder in this location will cause your code to periodically not run and I cannot help you fix it."

Your goal is to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade. Please be thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.\nThis reflection will be done in the reflection_template.qmd file provided in the repository. The structure of the document is as follows:\n\nWhat grade did you earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.\nFor each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.\n\n\nSome learning targets ask for one example, some ask for two examples, and some ask for specific examples relative to particular data types.\nYour Lab assignments and Challenge problems should be a primary source of these examples, but you can also include other items. Anything that supports your argument for a grade can be submitted.\nYou must indicate where the code you provided came from, including the title of the assignment and problem number either next to the code title (e.g., xlsx\nLab 2 Question 1) or as a code comment at the top of the code chunk.\nNote, your code is not expected to run! The execute options at the top of the Quarto file are set to eval: false. Thus, you do not need to load in any packages or datasets in your reflection.\n\n\nHow did you meet that grade‚Äôs requirements? The requirements for grades are found in the course syllabus section of the syllabus. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you‚Äôve earned. Be specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you‚Äôve met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met.\nWhat else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that isn‚Äôt explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you‚Äôre thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be focused, specific, and thorough ‚Äî and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.\n\nPlus/minus grades: You may argue to add a ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äù modifier to your grade. Generally speaking a ‚Äú+‚Äù added to a letter grade means you‚Äôve met all the criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a ‚Äú-‚Äù means that you have met the requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare minimum, or you‚Äôve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except for a small number of minor criteria."

In this essay, give an explanation of what that term ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance.

It‚Äôs possible that STAT 331 has been the most challenging course on your schedule this quarter, perhaps in your entire college career so far. I want you to know that I see you, I respect your efforts, and it‚Äôs extremely fulfilling to see you respond to the challenges and grow.\nI also want to be clear that while the time and effort spent on the class are vitally important, they are not explicitly part of the grade criteria you find in the syllabus. So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, I respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class.\nYou are free to discuss your investment in time and effort in the essay questions if you like, or apart from the portfolio if that makes more sense. But when making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of your investment of time and effort. Did your efforts result in several exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made you a valuable group member."

    "section": "Questions you might have",
    "text": "Questions you might have\n\nQ: What if you disagree with our final grade reflection?\n\nA: There are two ways this might happen.\n\nYou ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports. That is, you grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the course, but I do not feel the evidence you‚Äôve provided supports this grade. If this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting.I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this feedback when constructing your final portfolio. If I believe the grade you‚Äôve proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you‚Äôve provided, I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting. I‚Äôll tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your grade request is correct, you‚Äôll have the chance to walk me through your materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the evidence supports. I have faith that we‚Äôll be able to come to a mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can‚Äôt, I will assign the grade that in my estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply overriding your grade determination.\nYou ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. That is, you ‚Äúlowball‚Äù yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you earned, and then just inform you that I‚Äôve done so (and why).\n\nIn my experience, the second situation happens significantly more frequently than the first.\n\n\n\nQ: Is there a limit on the number of artifacts I can include to support my grade?\n\nA: There is no strict limit, but please be selective.\nQuality, not quantity is what we are after. We do not want every assignment in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in fewer than 8 assignments with judicious selection of homework solutions and other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a massive binder of mediocre examples.\n\n\n\nQ: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone‚Äôs question on Discord?\n\nA: This isn‚Äôt filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn‚Äôt necessary.\nDetails and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness here. For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord, pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you say? Why was that comment an example of ‚Äúhelpful feedback‚Äù? (Do you know that it was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you‚Äôve earned a particular grade.\n\n\n\nQ: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a ‚ÄúD‚Äù in the class?\n\nA: Yes, if the person is honest and there‚Äôs not enough evidence to make the case for a ‚ÄúC‚Äù.\nIf you‚Äôre in that situation, be honest and don‚Äôt overreach just because the consequences are significant.\n\n\n\nQ: How long should the essays be?\n\nA: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses ‚Äî without going overboard and writing more than you need.\nThere is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.\n\n\n\nQ: What if you do not submit a final portfolio?\n\nA: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion.\nI will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.\nI‚Äôll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up."

    "text": "California Childcare Costs\nLet‚Äôs start by focusing only on California.\n2. Create a ca_childcare dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the childcare_costs dataset. Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.\n3. Using a function from the forcats package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the ten (10) Census regions in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.\nHint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI have provided you with code that eliminates the word ‚ÄúCounty‚Äù from each of the county names in your ca_childcare dataset. You should keep this line of code and pipe into the rest of your data manipulations.\nYou will learn about the str_remove() function from the stringr package next week!\n\n\n\nca_childcare &lt;- ca_childcare |&gt; \n  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, \" County\")) |&gt;\n  ...\n\n4. Let‚Äôs consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the median of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the region and the study_year. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions!\n\n\n5. Which California region had the lowest median full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this region correspond to the region with the lowest median income in 2018 that you found in Q4?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.\n\n\n6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions.\nYou will also be required to use functions from forcats to change the labels and the ordering of your factor levels.\nRemember to avoid ‚Äúobject junk‚Äù in your environment!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot to recreate"

Create side-by-side boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight (y-axis) within each species (x-axis).\nA fundamental complaint of boxplots is that they do not plot the raw data. However, with ggplot we can add the raw data points on top of the boxplots!\n11. Add another layer to your previous plot that plots each observation.\n\nAlright, this should look less than optimal. Your points should appear rather stacked on top of each other. To make them less stacked, we need to jitter them a bit, using geom_jitter().\n12. Remove the previous layer and include a geom_jitter() layer instead.\n\nThat should look a bit better! But its really hard to see the points when everything is black.\n13. Set the color aesthetic in geom_jitter() to change the color of the points and add set the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to use whatever color you wish! Some of my favorites are \"orange3\" and \"steelblue\".\n\n\nGreat! Now that you can see the points, you should notice something odd: there are two colors of points still being plotted. Some of the observations are being plotted twice, once from geom_boxplot() as outliers and again from geom_jitter()!\n14. Inspect the help file for geom_boxplot() and see how you can remove the outliers from being plotted by geom_boxplot(). Make this change in your code!\n\nSome small changes can make big differences to plots. One of these changes are better labels for a plot‚Äôs axes and legend.\n15. Modify the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to describe what is being plotted. Be sure to include any necessary units! You might also be getting overlap in the species names ‚Äì use theme(axis.text.x = ____) or theme(axis.text.y = ____) to turn the species axis labels 45 degrees.\n\nSome people (and journals) prefer for boxplots to be stacked with a specific orientation! Let‚Äôs practice changing the orientation of our boxplots.\n16. Now copy-paste your boxplot code you‚Äôve been adding to above. Flip the orientation of your boxplots. The variable that was mapped to the x-axis should now be included on the y-axis and visa versa.\nNotice how vertically stacked boxplots make the species labels more readable than horizontally stacked boxplots (even when the axis labels are rotated). This is good practice!"

Make sure to indicate what additional touches you added, and provide any online references you used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor this challenge you will be modifying the code you wrote for Lab 2 ‚Äì we will be modifying the box plot of weights by species!"

    "text": "Embedding Legend in Plot Title\nThe ggtext package allows you to add hex colors and other HTML elements (e.g., italics, boldface) to plot titles. The process involves two main steps:\n\nWrap your text in HTML tags within the labs() function.\nTell ggplot to render the HTML by adding plot.title = element_markdown() inside the theme() function.\n\nLet‚Äôs see how this can look! I‚Äôve added the hex colors for the islands to the subtitle of my plot:\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = island)\n       ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = untitled_red) +\n  labs(x = \"Bill Length (mm)\", \n       y = \"\", \n       title = \"Length of Different Penguin Species' Bills\", \n       subtitle = \"Separated by &lt;span style = 'color:#c8251d;'&gt;Biscoe&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style = 'color:#a11b26;'&gt;Dream&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:#ef6552;'&gt;Torgenson&lt;/span&gt; Islands\") +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\", \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown()\n    ) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the subtitle is still specified as a string. Inside the string there are HTML elements (&lt;span&gt;) that declare the colors of the text. For example, &lt;span style = 'color:#c8251d;'&gt;Biscoe&lt;/span&gt; declares that the text ‚ÄúBiscoe‚Äù should be printed with the color #c8251d. The beginning of the span (&lt;span) and the end of the span (&lt;/span&gt;) declare when the coloring starts and ends.\n\nFor this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created in Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable sex. Next, you need to move the legend colors for each level of sex into the plot title or subtitle. Finally, you are expected to use the theme() function to remove the color legend from the plot, since it is no longer needed!"

This function will return all of the rows of one dataset without a match in another dataset.\n4. Use the anti_join() function to filter out the Country values we don‚Äôt want in the military_clean data. The by argument needs to be filled with the name(s) of the variables that the two datasets should be joined with.\nHint: To join by different variables in data1 and data2 you need to use by = join_by(a == b), which will match data1$a to data2$b.\n\nCanvas Question #1\n5.

The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two ‚Äúroles‚Äù‚ÄîDeveloper and Coder. We will discuss these roles in class, but you can find descriptions of the scope of each role on the Pair Programming Roles document.\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is ‚ÄúPrograms must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.‚Äù Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else‚Äôs code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing ‚Äútidy‚Äù and ‚Äúefficient‚Äù code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone‚Äôs code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It‚Äôs easy to be a jerk when making comments; don‚Äôt. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other."

There are channels for the different components of each week (e.g., Week 1 Lab Assignment). Please do not send an email about homework questions or questions about the course material. It is incredibly helpful for others in the course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions.

If you thought you were going to get an assignment in but you just missed the deadline for an assignment, please go complete a deadline extension request ASAP. I will not provide feedback on assignments which missed the deadline and no extension request was completed.\nTokens cannot be ‚Äústacked‚Äù; you cannot use multiple tokens to purchase a 6-day extension.

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. Students in this class are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class meetings, and to carefully and respectfully listen to each other. During the first few weeks of class, we‚Äôll work together to create a set of norms that will govern our interactions with each other, to ensure that we‚Äôre always respectful of everyone.\nSo that everyone feels comfortable participating, every member of this class must show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It‚Äôs easy to be a jerk when making comments; don‚Äôt. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other.\nIn general, when I give feedback I like to start off with praise for something the person did right. Starting off with something positive helps soften the blow when you receive feedback that points out places you still have room to grow.\n\nExample Reviews\n\n\nggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=\"blue\"))\n\nMy Review\n‚ÄúI really appreciate your use of named arguments, it makes it clear what each input is being used for. Your code would be much easier to read if you used spaces before and after your = signs and after each comma. I would also recommend hitting enter / return after each + sign, so that each‚Äùlayer‚Äù of your plot has its own line. This makes it easier to digest what is happening at each stage of your plot.‚Äù\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% mutate(mass_flipper_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%   group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(avg_mass_flipper_ratio = median(mass_flipper_ratio)) %&gt;% arrange(avg_mass_flipper_ratio)\n\nMy Review\n‚ÄúI really appreciate how you use spaces before and after each = sign, that makes it easier to read how each = sign is being used. I also have a suggestion for your code formatting which would make your code easier to read. If you use a return / new line after each %&gt;% sign, each step of your pipeline is on its own line and it is easier to understand the process you are implementing.‚Äù\n\n\ncolleges_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(REGION == 7,\n         ADM_RATE &gt; region_median,\n         TUITION_DIFF != 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    SAT_odd = SAT_AVG %% 2 != 0\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(SAT_odd == TRUE,\n         STABBR != \"ID\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    freshman = as.numeric(UGDS) / 4, \n    applications = freshman / ADM_RATE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(applications &lt; 1000, \n         STABBR != \"MT\")\n\nMy Review\n‚ÄúYour code formatting is awesome! I really appreciate your use of whitespace and returns to break up your code and make it more readable. The main suggestion I have is to pay attention to how many times you are calling the same function during your data wrangling process. For example, in your code you use the filter() function three times. Could you do all this filtering in one call to the filter() function? That would help make your code more efficient!‚Äù"

However, there are a few additional rules to keep things fun:\n\nThis exercise must be done in complete silence. No talking is permitted.\nYou may not point or signal to other players with your hands in any way.\nEach player must put together their own circle. No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces‚Äîone at a time‚Äîto any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you. As per the previous rule, you may not place a piece in another person‚Äôs puzzle; players must complete their own puzzle. Instead, you are expected to hand the piece to the other player."

    "text": "Solve the Mystery\nJust down the road in Montecito, CA several rare jewels went missing. The jewels were stolen and replaced with fakes, but detectives have not been able to solve the case. They are now calling in a data scientist to help parse their clues.\nA camera was located near the building where the jewels went missing, so the detectives have provided you with a list of people who may have entered the building. This list includes the date and time they were spotted on the camera, in Pacific Standard Time (PST).\nUnfortunately, the date and time of the jewel heist is not known. You have been hired to crack the case. Use the clues below to discover the thief‚Äôs identity.\n\nsuspects &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoerehnberg/STAT331-S23/main/practice_activities/suspects.csv\")\n\ndim(suspects)\n\n[1] 214   3\n\n# 214 total suspects\n\n\n\nThe crime was committed in Montecito, CA, so we need to make sure the time zone for these dates are correct. Modify the Time.Spotted variable to have the correct time zone.\n\n\nBased on the cleaning schedule for the room where the jewels are held, the heist was not committed in the morning.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 112 suspects left\n\n\nThe room where the heist was committed is closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays (and there were no signs of forced entry), so the heist did not happen on those days.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 78 suspects left\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the heist was committed within 5 weeks (35 days) of Thanksgiving 2022. Hint: Pay attention to time zones!\n\n\n# After this step you should have 11 suspects left\n\n\nThe detectives partially decoded a message from the thief to a notorious fence in Iceland. In it, the thief said the job would be done ‚Äúafter the sun sets for you, but before midnight.‚Äù Hint: When does the sun set in Iceland at that time of year?\n\n\n# After this step you should have 4 suspects left\n\n\nThe thief left behind a receipt at the scene of the crime. The receipt is smudged, but the day of the month is shown to be 22. It is thought that the heist took place no more than three days after the receipt was issued.\n\n\n# After this step you should have 2 suspects left\n\n\n\nThe thief is amused by your efforts and has sent you a cryptic clue:\n\n\n‚ÄúThe exact number of seconds between midnight on Jan 1, 1970 and the time I arrived on the scene is divisible by 6.‚Äù\n\n\n# You should end with 1 suspect left"

    "text": "The Data\nThe teacher_evals dataset contains student evaluations of reaching (SET) collected from students at a University in Poland. There are SET surveys from students in all fields and all levels of study offered by the university. 1\nThe SET questionnaire that every student at this university completes is as follows:\n\nEvaluation survey of the teaching staff of University of Poland. Please complete the following evaluation form, which aims to assess the lecturer‚Äôs performance. Only one answer should be indicated for each question. The answers are coded in the following way:\n5: I strongly agree\n4: I agree\n3: Neutral\n2: I don‚Äôt agree\n1: I strongly don‚Äôt agree\nQuestion 1: I learned a lot during the course.\nQuestion 2: I think that the knowledge acquired during the course is very useful.\nQuestion 3: The professor used activities to make the class more engaging.\nQuestion 4: If it was possible, I would enroll for a course conducted by this lecturer again.\nQuestion 5: The classes started on time.\nQuestion 6: The lecturer always used time efficiently.\nQuestion 7: The lecturer delivered the class content in an understandable and efficient way.\nQuestion 8: The lecturer was available when we had doubts.\nQuestion 9. The lecturer treated all students equally regardless of their race, background and ethnicity.\n\nThese data are from the end of the winter semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. In the period of data collection, all university classes were entirely online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While expected learning outcomes were not changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could have implications for data.\nAverage SET scores were combined with many other variables, including:\n\ncharacteristics of the teacher (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in the past 6 semesters).\ncharacteristics of the course (time of day, day of the week, course type, course breadth, class duration, class size).\npercentage of students providing SET feedback.\ncourse grades (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the current course and previous six semesters).\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new hypotheses.\nBefore tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable in the data dictionary here. You will want to have this open and refer back to it!\n1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis. Hint: The ggplot2 package and the readr package can both be loaded with the tidyverse package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: packages\n# Code to load in packages necessary for the analysis\n```\n\n2. Load in the teacher_evals data. Hint: You should use the here() function from the here package!\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-data\n# Code to load in the data for the analysis\n```\n\n\nData Inspection + Summary\n3. Provide a brief overview (~4 sentences) of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to start an analysis by getting a feel for the data and providing a quick summary for readers. You do not need to show any code for this question, although you probably want to use code to get some information about the data (e.g., summary(data), glimpse(data), dim(data), etc.). Things you should think about:\n‚Äì where did the data come from? - what is the context of the data? - how much data do you have? - what sort of data (e.g., variables, data type)?\n\n\n4. What is the unit of observation (i.e.¬†a single row in the dataset) identified by?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is not one instructor per row! It‚Äôs also not just one class per row!\n\n\n5. Use one dplyr pipeline to clean the data by:\n\nrenaming the gender variable to sex\nremoving all courses with fewer than 10 respondents\nchanging data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID really a numeric data type?)\nonly keeping the columns we will use ‚Äì course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share, SET_score_avg, percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, and sex\n\nAssign your cleaned data to a new variable named teacher_evals_clean ‚Äì- use these data going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: rename(), mutate(), as.character()\nIt would be most efficient to use across() in combination with mutate() if you are changing the data type of three or more variables.\n\n\n6. How many unique instructors and unique courses are present in the cleaned dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: summarize(), n_distinct()\n\n\n7. What are the demographics of the instructors in this study? Investigate the variables academic_degree, seniority, and sex and summarize your findings in ~3 complete sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll need to first wrangle your data to have each instructor represented only once.\nHelpful functions: select(), distinct(___, .keep_all = TRUE), count(), summarize()\n\n\n8. One teacher-course combination has some missing values, coded as NA. Which instructor has these missing values? Which course? What variable are the missing values in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: filter(), if_any(), is.na()\n\n\n9. Each course seems to have used a different subset of the nine evaluation questions. How many teacher-course combinations asked all nine questions?"

    "section": "Central Limit Theorem ‚Äì Optional & Somewhat Spicy",
    "text": "Central Limit Theorem ‚Äì Optional & Somewhat Spicy\nYou have encountered the Central Limit Theorem in your previous statistics classes, whether or not is has been explicitly discussed. The Central Limit Theorem states that:\n\nThe sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population.\n\nRemember back to your first statistics class when you had to check if the sample size was larger than 30 when testing if groups had different means? That‚Äôs because of the Central Limit Theorem! Under certain conditions (e.g., sample size) the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the distribution of sample means will be approximately Normal, regardless of how skewed the underlying distribution of the population may be.\nA fundamental misunderstanding of the Central Limit Theorem is that it states that as a sample size gets larger, the population will be normally distributed. This is not the case, so let‚Äôs do some exploring!\n4. Write a function that simulates a specified number of sample means, for samples of size 100 drawn from a Chi-Squared distribution. Your function should allow the user to input:\n\nthe number of means to simulate\nthe degrees of freedom of the Chi-Squared distribution used to simulate data\n\nI‚Äôve provided some skeleton code to get you started. :)\n\nsimulate_means &lt;- function(n, df){\n  map_dbl(.x = , \n          .f = ~rchisq(n = 100, ...) %&gt;% mean()\n          )\n}\n\n5. Next, let‚Äôs use the crossing() function to make a grid with inputs we want to pass into the simulate_means() function. Specifically, we want to explore the following values:\n\nn = 10, 100, 1000, 10000\ndf = 10\n\n\ngrid &lt;- crossing(n = c(10, 100, 1000, 10000), \n                 df = 5)\n\n6. Now, use a p_map() to create a new column of simulated means (using the simulate_means() function), for every value in your grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will want to use the unnest() function to extract the results of the p_map() (stored in the simulated_means column).\n\n\n\nall_simulations &lt;- grid |&gt; \n  mutate(simulated_means = pmap(.l = list(), \n                                .f = simulate_means)\n         ) |&gt; \n  unnest() \n\n7. Create a table of the means from each of the simulations (10, 100, 1000, and 10000). Hint: Make sure your columns have descriptive names!\n8. Create a plot showing the distribution of simulated means from each of the simulations. Each simulation (10, 100, 1000, and 10000) should be its own facet! Hint: Make sure your facets have descriptive names! You might also want to free the y-axis of the plots, since there are substantial differences in the sample sizes between the simulations.\nFor extra pizzazz, add a vertical line for true mean (for a Chi-Square the mean is the degrees of freedom)."

The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost.\nThe course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the activity.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nDue Mondays at 5pm\nAfter class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you‚Äôve learned. If you got something wrong, don‚Äôt worry! You‚Äôll have a chance to try again.\nLabs will be submitted on Canvas.

Frequently, you have the choice of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\nAlthough you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text absolutely must be your own.\nChallenges will be submitted on Canvas.

Here, you will find three options for installing R‚Äîclick on the option for your computer‚Äôs operating system.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Windows user:\n\nClick on ‚ÄúDownload R for Windows‚Äù\nClick on ‚Äúbase‚Äù\nClick on the Download link.\nWhen you open the execution file (.exe) you will be prompted with a variety of questions about installing R. Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click ‚ÄúOk‚Äù until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer‚Äôs settings\nClick on the ‚ÄúApps‚Äù option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on ‚ÄúDownload R for (Mac) OS X‚Äù\nUnder ‚ÄúLatest release:‚Äù click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of July 1, 2024 was R-4.4.1 (Race for Your Life).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you‚Äôre going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can‚Äôt, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on ‚ÄúDownload R for Linux‚Äù and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup."

You can get by without regular expressions if you‚Äôre creative, but often they‚Äôre much simpler.\n\nüìñ Recommended Reading: R4DS Chapter 15 (Regular Expressions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead at least through Section 15.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort Regular Expressions Primer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this web app built to test R regular expressions. The subset of regular expression syntax we‚Äôre going to cover here is fairly limited, but you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related. As with any tool, there are situations where it‚Äôs useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.\nHere are the basics of regular expressions:\n\n[] enclose sets of characters\nFor example, [abc] will match any single character a, b, c\n- specifies a range of characters (A-z matches all upper and lower case letters)\n. matches any character (except a newline)\nTo match special characters, escape them using \\ (in most languages) or \\\\ (in R). So \\. or \\\\. will match a literal ., \\$ or \\\\$ will match a literal $.\n\n\nnum_string &lt;- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\nstr_extract(num_string, \"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\")\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n\nRepeating Patterns\nListing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?\n\n* means repeat between 0 and inf times\n+ means 1 or more times\n? means 0 or 1 times ‚Äì most useful when you‚Äôre looking for something optional\n{a, b} means repeat between a and b times, where a and b are integers. `\nNote that b can be blank. So [abc]{3,} will match abc, aaaa, cbbaa, but not ab, bb, or a.\nFor a single number of repeated characters, you can use {a}. So {3, } means ‚Äú3 or more times‚Äù and {3} means ‚Äúexactly 3 times‚Äù\n\n\nnum_string &lt;- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *two* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by a dash.\nssn &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\")\nssn\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by any character, \nphone &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}\")\nphone\n\n[1] \"123-456-7890\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *eight* numbers \nnuid &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{8}\")\nnuid\n\n[1] \"12345678\"\n\n\nAnchoring\nThere are also ways to ‚Äúanchor‚Äù a pattern to a part of the string (e.g.¬†the beginning or the end)\n\n^ has multiple meanings:\n\nif it‚Äôs the first character in a pattern, ^ matches the beginning of a string\nif it follows [, e.g.¬†[^abc], ^ means ‚Äúnot‚Äù - for instance, ‚Äúthe collection of all characters that aren‚Äôt a, b, or c‚Äù.\n\n$ means the end of a string\n\nCombined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.\n\naddress &lt;- \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500\"\n\n# Match a sequence of one or more digits at the beginning of the string\nhouse_num &lt;- str_extract(address, \"^[0-9]{1,}\")\nhouse_num\n\n[1] \"1600\"\n\n# Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma\nstreet &lt;- str_extract(address, \"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}\")\n# Remove house number from street address\nstreet &lt;- str_remove(street, house_num) |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim() \nstreet\n\n[1] \"Pennsylvania Ave NW\"\n\n# Match one or more characters between the two commas  \ncity &lt;- str_extract(address, \",.+,\") |&gt; \n  # Remove the leading and trailing commas\n  str_remove_all(\",\") |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim()\ncity\n\n[1] \"Washington D.C.\"\n\n# Matches both 5 and 9 digit zip codes found at the end of the string\nzip &lt;- str_extract(address, \"[0-9-]{5,10}$\") \nzip\n\n[1] \"20500\"\n\n\nMaking Groups\n\n() are used to capture information. So ([0-9]{4}) captures any 4-digit number\na|b will select a or b.\n\nIf you‚Äôve captured information using (), you can reference that information using back references. In most languages, those look like this: \\1 for the first reference, \\9 for the ninth. In R, back references are \\\\1 through \\\\9, because the \\ character is special, so you have to escape it.\n\nphone_num_variants &lt;- c(\"(123) 456-7980\", \"123.456.7890\", \"+1 123-456-7890\")\n\nphone_regex &lt;- \"\\\\+?[0-9]{0,3}? ?\\\\(?([0-9]{3})?\\\\)?.?([0-9]{3}).?([0-9]{4})\"\n# \\\\+?[0-9]{0,3} matches the country code, if specified, \n#    but won't take the first 3 digits from the area code \n#    unless a country code is also specified\n# \\\\( and \\\\) match literal parentheses if they exist\n# ([0-9]{3})? captures the area code, if it exists\n# .? matches any character\n# ([0-9]{3}) captures the exchange code\n# ([0-9]{4}) captures the 4-digit individual code\n\nstr_extract(phone_num_variants, phone_regex)\n\n[1] \"(123) 456-7980\"  \"123.456.7890\"    \"+1 123-456-7890\"\n\n# We didn't capture the country code, so it remained in the string\n\nhuman_talk &lt;- \"blah, blah, blah.

    "text": "1.1 Tidy Evaluation\nWriting functions that work with data frames and call on the functions we‚Äôve become used to (e.g., filter(), select(), summarise()) requires we learn about tidy evaluation. To write these functions you will need to know, at a high level, whether the function you are trying to incorporate uses data masking or tidy selection.\nAt a high level, data masking is used in functions like arrange(), filter(), and summarize() that compute with variables. Whereas, tidy selection is used for functions like select() and rename() that select variables.\nYour intuition about which functions use tidy evaluation should be good for many of these functions. If you can input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function (e.g., select(mtcars, c(vs, am, gear))), then the function uses tidy selection! If you cannot input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function, then the function is performing computations on the data and uses data masking.\nIf you are interested in learning more about tidy evaluation, I would highly recommend:\n\nthis video by Jenny Bryan\n\nI do want to note that this video is from 2019 and some things have changed since then.

    "text": "2.1 Is every function vectorized?\nShort answer, no. There exist occasions where you either can‚Äôt or choose not to write a function that is vectorized. For example, if the function you‚Äôve written makes use of if() statements, your function cannot operate on vectors. For example, take the pos_neg_zero() function below:\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  if(x &gt; 0){\n    return(\"Greater than 0!\")\n  } else if (x &lt; 0){\n    return(\"Less than 0!\")\n  } else {\n    return(\"Equal to 0!\")\n      }\n}\n\nWhen I call the pos_neg_zero() function on a vector I receive an error:\n\nx &lt;- seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\nError in if (x &gt; 0) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nThis error means that the if(x &gt; 0) condition can only be checked for something of length 1. So, to use this function on the vector x, you would need to apply the function individually to each element:\n\nresult &lt;- rep(NA, \n              length(x)\n              )\n\nfor(i in 1:length(x)){\n  result[i] &lt;- pos_neg_zero(x[i])\n}\n\nresult\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector initialization\n\n\n\nNote that I initialized a result vector to store the results of calling the pos_neg_zero() function for the vector x. Similar to C++ and Java, R is an assembly language that requires objects be created before they are used, which is why I couldn‚Äôt initialize result inside the for()-loop. Second, when I initialized the result vector I made it the size I wanted, rather than iteratively making it larger and larger (which makes operations incredibly slow).\n\n\nYes, I could have written a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù function which used a vectorized function (e.g., case-when()) instead of a non-vectorized function (e.g., if()).\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  state &lt;- case_when(x &gt; 0 ~ \"Greater than 0!\", \n                     x &lt; 0 ~ \"Less than 0!\", \n                     .default = \"Equal to 0!\")\n  return(state)\n}\n\nWhen I call this function on the vector x, I no longer receive an error:\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\nThat‚Äôs because the case_when() is vectorized!"

Well, we could rely on our old CS 101 friend, the for()-loop:\n\ndata_type &lt;- rep(NA, \n                 length = ncol(penguins)\n                 )\n\nfor(i in 1:ncol(penguins)){\n  data_type[i] &lt;- typeof(penguins[[i]])\n}\n\n## Getting a nicely formatted table!\ntibble(column = names(penguins), \n       type = data_type) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = column, \n              values_from = type) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\ninteger\ninteger\ndouble\ndouble\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, for()-loops are not as important as they are in other languages because R is a functional programming language. In fact, we would prefer not to use for()-loops as they do not take advantage of R‚Äôs functional programming. Take for example, our friend across() that we talked about at the beginning of this reading:\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    across(\n      .cols = everything(), \n      .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x))\n      )\n    ) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n11\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe across() function looks like an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù function, it applies a specified function / functions to the columns specified. However, when you look at the source code for across() you will find a for()-loop:\n\nfor (j in seq_fns) {\n  fn &lt;- fns[[j]]\n  out[[k]] &lt;- fn(col, ...)\n  k &lt;- k + 1L\n  }\n\nThis shows you that it is possible to include for()-loops in a function, and call that function instead of using the for()-loop directly."

For example, If we wanted to standardize a numeric variable to be centered at the mean and scaled by the standard deviation, we could use the following function:\n\n\nstandardize &lt;- function(vec) {\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(vec))\n  \n  # Center with mean\n  deviations &lt;- vec - mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  # Scale with standard deviation\n  newdata &lt;- deviations / sd(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  return(newdata)\n}\n\nWhy does the following return a vector of NAs?\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    body_mass_g = map_dbl(body_mass_g, standardize)\n  )\n\n\nBecause body_mass_g needs to be passed to standardize() as an argument\nBecause mutate() operates on rows, so map_dbl() is supplying standardize() with one row of body_mass_g at a time\nBecause map_dbl() only takes one input, so you need to use map2_dbl() instead\nBecause there is no function named standardize(), so it cannot be applied to the body_mass_g column\nbody_mass_g is not a data frame so it is not a valid argument for map_dbl()\n\n\nThus far in the course, we have used the across() function to apply the same function to multiple columns. For example, if we wanted to apply the standardize() function from above to every numeric column, we could use the following code:\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), \n                .fns = standardize)\n         )\n\n# A tibble: 344 √ó 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.883         0.784            -1.42      -0.563 \n 2 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.810         0.126            -1.06      -0.501 \n 3 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.663         0.430            -0.421     -1.19  \n 4 Adelie  Torgersen         NA            NA                NA         NA     \n 5 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.32          1.09             -0.563     -0.937 \n 6 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.847         1.75             -0.776     -0.688 \n 7 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.920         0.329            -1.42      -0.719 \n 8 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.865         1.24             -0.421      0.590 \n 9 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.80          0.480            -0.563     -0.906 \n10 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.352         1.54             -0.776      0.0602\n# ‚Ñπ 334 more rows\n# ‚Ñπ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWhich of the following map functions would return the same output?\n\n## Option (a)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize)\n\n## Option (b)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()\n\n## Option (c)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) \n\n## Option (d)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()"
