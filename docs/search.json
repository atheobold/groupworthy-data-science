The R Project lives in this folder for two reasons, (1) when you copied the Lab 1 GitHub repository you told RStudio you wanted to make a new R Project, and (2) in order for RStudio to talk with GitHub you need to use an R Project.\nHowever, if you look at your STAT331 folder (the one that lives in your Documents folder), you should not see a blue cube since we never created an R Project in this folder. Let’s do that now!\nTo add a R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already created a folder for this class), first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\nNavigation prompt for creating a new R Project in an existing directory\n\n\nThen, browse on your computer to where you saved your STAT331 folder last week. This should be in your Documents folder, similar to where mine is saved!\n\n\n\nNavigation prompt for selecting which existing folder in which the R Project should be created.\n\n\nOnce you click “Create Project”, your existing folder, STAT331 should now contain a STAT331.Rproj file.

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. [This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn’t play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nIn this class, we will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na “Stat 331” folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 331\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)\na separate R Studio Project (and GitHub repository) associated with each assignment\n\nFor example, if you come to my office for help on your lab assignment for Week 2, I would expect your files to look like this:\n\nFile Storage on WindowsFile Storage on a Mac\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.”\n\nInside my STAT 331 folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.” You can tell what folders Lab 1 lives inside based on the information included at the top of the screen. This is called a “file path,” which tells your computer where a folder / file lives on the computer.\nOn a PC, every file lives on the C Drive, so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\nC:/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.” Inside this folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.”\nOn a Mac, every file lives on the hard drive (it doesn’t have letters like a PC), so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\n/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1",

Note that getting the general structure and reader friendly labels is good enough, but my favorite colors are “steelblue” and “orange3”, and my favorite theme is black/white!\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q13\n\n14. Look up the documentation for chisq.test() to carry out a chi-square test of independence between the SET level and instructor seniority level in your new dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the chisq.test() function does not take a formula / data specification as we have seen before. You will need to extract the variables you wish to include in the analysis using a $ (e.g., evals$level$).\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q14\n\n15.

Instead, we could perform all these tasks as one long “pipeline.”\nStep 8: Combine your (fixed) code chunks into a single code chunk that carries out all of the steps necessary to clean the data.\nThink about coding efficiency – you should not have multiple calls to the same function!\n\n# Code combining ALL of your previous steps into ONE pipeline"

No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces—one at a time—to any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you.

I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other.\nIn general, when I give feedback I like to start off with praise for something the person did right. Starting off with something positive helps soften the blow when you receive feedback that points out places you still have room to grow.\n\nExample Reviews\n\n\nggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=displ,y=hwy,color=\"blue\"))\n\nMy Review\n“I really appreciate your use of named arguments, it makes it clear what each input is being used for. Your code would be much easier to read if you used spaces before and after your = signs and after each comma. I would also recommend hitting enter / return after each + sign, so that each”layer” of your plot has its own line. This makes it easier to digest what is happening at each stage of your plot.”\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% mutate(mass_flipper_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm) %&gt;%   group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(avg_mass_flipper_ratio = median(mass_flipper_ratio)) %&gt;% arrange(avg_mass_flipper_ratio)\n\nMy Review\n“I really appreciate how you use spaces before and after each = sign, that makes it easier to read how each = sign is being used. I also have a suggestion for your code formatting which would make your code easier to read. If you use a return / new line after each %&gt;% sign, each step of your pipeline is on its own line and it is easier to understand the process you are implementing.”\n\n\ncolleges_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(REGION == 7,\n         ADM_RATE &gt; region_median,\n         TUITION_DIFF != 0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    SAT_odd = SAT_AVG %% 2 != 0\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(SAT_odd == TRUE,\n         STABBR != \"ID\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    freshman = as.numeric(UGDS) / 4, \n    applications = freshman / ADM_RATE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(applications &lt; 1000, \n         STABBR != \"MT\")\n\nMy Review\n“Your code formatting is awesome! I really appreciate your use of whitespace and returns to break up your code and make it more readable. The main suggestion I have is to pay attention to how many times you are calling the same function during your data wrangling process. For example, in your code you use the filter() function three times. Could you do all this filtering in one call to the filter() function? That would help make your code more efficient!”"

There is not an expectation that you have seen R before, only that you have some experiences with computing (writing code and executing code). For those who have not seen R before, it is an open-source programming language developed by Statisticians, and is one of the main “languages” you will find people use when doing statistics in the wild.\nIn this course, we will learn the foundational skills for programming in R and a variety of skills for working with data.

When I grade your Lab and Challenge assignments, I will mark each problem with an S, a G, or an N. You will have the option to retry any Learning Targets for which you scored a G or an N on. When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—I need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nIf your revisions do not include reflections by the deadline, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from my STAT 313 course, but I think you’ll get the idea.\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.\n\nIt is my goal to have your lab and challenge assignments (which are due on Sunday night) back to you no later than Thursday, so we can spend time talking about the revisions during class. You will then have until the following Friday to complete your revisions on the problems you received a G or an N on.",

    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two “roles”—recorder and listener. We will discuss these roles in class, but here are some rough descriptions of the scope of each role:\n\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else’s code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing “tidy” and “efficient” code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone’s code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other.",

This included the R code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.\nIn this class the assumed knowledge is the course materials, including the course textbook, coursework pages, and course slides. Any functions / code used outside of these materials require direct references. This includes any functions learned through R documentation for functions we have learned. Meaning, if you look up the help file for mutate() and you learn about a function not covered in the course materials, you are required to cite the documentation when using that function.\nEven inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another’s work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you use external resources such as Google or ChatGPT, I expect you to indicate this in your assignment.\n\nIf you used Google, you are expected to “inform” me of any resources you used by pasting the link to the resource in a code comment next to where you used that resource.\nIf you used ChatGPT, you are expected to “inform” me of the assistance you received by (1) indicating somewhere in the problem that you used ChatGPT (e.g., below the question prompt or as a code comment), and (2) downloading and attaching the .txt file containing your entire conversation with ChatGPT.\n\nIt is both good professional practice and academic integrity to cite any resources you used during your work. The first incident of failing to cite your resources, will result in a warning. The second incident of failing to cite your resources will result in a 0 on the assignment, meaning you will not be able to include any code from that Lab or Challenge in your Final Portfolio. You will also be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.\nIf you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.",

The designer is then tasked with instructing the players how to replicate the design they created, but there are some rules.\n\nThe designer cannot touch the players shapes.\nThe designer cannot tell the players how to assemble the shapes into the correct design.\nThe designer can respond to questions posed by the players.\n\n\n\nPlayers\n“Players” are tasked with solving the design made by the “designer.” Players can pose questions to the designer to uncover their design. Once an player believes they have figured out the design, the designer should check their solution. If the designer says the solution is correct, then the player can assist the designer in answering questions posed by the other players.\n\n\nObserver\nThe “observer” is tasked with monitoring the interactions between the designer and the players. Specifically, the observer should check off the number of times they see two behaviors occurring, (1) explaining by telling how, and (2) everybody helps. The observer should have a scoring sheet to tally the number of times they see each behavior."

    "title": "Challenge 2: Spicing things up with ggplot2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For this week’s Challenge, you will have three different options to explore. I’ve arranged these options in terms of their “spiciness,” or the difficulty of completing the task. You are only required to complete one task, but if you are interested in exploring more than one, feel free!\nThis is a great place to let your creativity show! Make sure to indicate what additional touches you added, and provide any online references you used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will be working in the challenge-2.qmd file, found in the repository you cloned for Lab 2. Within this document, make sure to specify that your plots are contained in your document (self-contained: true) and that your code is visible to the reader (echo: true). If there are other formatting specifics you would like to include, feel free to toss those in the YAML, too!\nThen, create a setup code chunk to load the packages and read in the surveys.csv data file exactly how you did in Lab 2.\nCreate another code chunk and paste in your code from Question 14 or Question 15 in Lab 2 – we will be modifying the box plot of weights by species!\n\n\n\n🌶 Medium: Ridge Plots\nIn Lab 2, you used side-by-side boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species of rodent. Boxplots have substantial flaws, namely that they disguise distributions with multiple modes.\nA “superior” alternative is the density plot. However, ggplot2 does not allow for side-by-side density plots using geom_density(). Instead, we will need to make use of the ggridges package to create side-by-side density (ridge) plots.\n\nFor this challenge you are to change your boxplots to ridge plots. You will need to install the ggridges package and explore the geom_density_ridges() function.\n\n\n\n🌶 🌶 Spicy: Exploring Color Themes\nThe built-in ggplot() color scheme may not include the colors you were looking for. Don’t worry – there are many other color palettes available to use!\nYou can change the colors used by ggplot() in a few different ways.\n\nManual Specification\nAdd the scale_color_manual() or scale_fill_manual() functions to your plot and directly specify the colors you want to use. You can either:\n\ndefine a vector of colors within the scale functions (e.g. values = c(\"blue\", \"black\", \"red\", \"green\")) OR\ncreate a vector of colors using hex numbers and store that vector as a variable. Then, call that vector in the scale_color_manual() function.\n\nHere are some exaplme hex color schemes:\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with gray:\ncdPalette_grey &lt;- c(\"#999999\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with black:\ncdPalette_blk &lt;- c(\"#000000\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in using specific hex colors, I like the image color picker app to find the colors I want.\n\n\n\n\nPackage Specification\nWhile manual specification may be necessary for some contexts, it can be a real pain to handpick 5+ colors. This is where color scales built-in to R packages come in handy! Popular packages for colors include:\n\nRColorBrewer – change colors by using scale_fill_brewer() or scale_colour_brewer().\nviridis – change colors by using scale_colour_viridis_d() for discrete data, scale_colour_viridis_c() for continuous data.\nggsci – change colors by using scale_color_&lt;PALNAME&gt;() or scale_fill_&lt;PALNAME&gt;(), where you specify the name of the palette you wish to use (e.g. scale_color_aaas()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website provides an exhaustive list of color themes available through various packages.\n\n\n\nIn this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable genus. Next, you are to change the colors used for genus using either manual color specification or any of the packages listed here (or others!).\n\n\n\n\n🌶 🌶 🌶 Hot: Exploring ggplot2 Annotation\nSome data scientists advocate that we should try to eliminate legends from our plots to make them more clear. Instead of using legends, which cause the reader’s eye to stray from the plot, we should use annotation.\nWe can add annotation(s) to a ggplot() using the annotate() function:\n\nggplot(data = surveys, \n       mapping = aes(y = species,\n                     x = weight,\n                     color = genus)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cdPalette_grey) + \n  annotate(\"text\", y = 6, x = 250, label = \"Sigmodon\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", y = 4, x = 250, label = \"Perognathus\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Weight (g)\",\n       y = \"\",\n       subtitle = \"Species\",\n       title = \"Rodent Weight by Species\")\n\nNote that I’ve labeled the “Sigmodon” and “Perognathus” genera, so the reader can tell that these boxplots are associated with their respective genus.\n\nIn this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created in Lab 2. First, you are to color the boxplots based on the variable genus. Next, you are to add annotations for each genus next to the boxplot(s) associated with that genus. Finally, you are expected to use the theme() function to remove the color legend from the plot, since it is no longer needed!"

However, with ggplot we can add the raw points on top of the boxplots!\n11. Add another layer to your previous plot that plots each observation.\n\nAlright, this should look less than optimal. Your points should appear rather stacked on top of each other. To make them less stacked, we need to jitter them a bit, using geom_jitter().\n12. Remove the previous layer and include a geom_jitter() layer instead.\n\nThat should look a bit better! But its really hard to see the points when everything is black.\n13. Set the color aesthetic in geom_jitter() to change the color of the points and add set the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to use whatever color you wish! Some of my favorites are “orange3” and “steelblue”.\n\n\nGreat! Now that you can see the points, you should notice something odd: there are two colors of points still being plotted. Some of the observations are being plotted twice, once from geom_boxplot() as outliers and again from geom_jitter()!\n14. Inspect the help file for geom_boxplot() and see how you can remove the outliers from being plotted by geom_boxplot(). Make this change in your code!\n\nSome small changes can make big differences to plots. One of these changes are better labels for a plot’s axes and legend.\n15. Modify the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to describe what is being plotted. Be sure to include any necessary units! You might also be getting overlap in the species names – use theme(axis.text.x = ____) or theme(axis.text.y = ____) to turn the species axis labels 45 degrees.\n\nSome people (and journals) prefer for boxplots to be stacked with a specific orientation! Let’s practice changing the orientation of our boxplots.\n16. Now copy-paste your boxplot code you’ve been adding to above. Flip the orientation of your boxplots. If you created horizontally stacked boxplots, your boxplots should now be stacked vertically. If you had vertically stacked boxplots, you should now stack your boxplots horizontally!\nNotice how vertically stacked boxplots make the species labels more readable than horizontally stacked boxplots (even when the axis labels are rotated).

(Much like this one!)\nThese are meant to replace the in-class lecture experience; thus, you should plan to devote about 1 - 3 hours a week to this coursework.\n\n\nPreview Activities\nDue Tuesdays before the beginning of class (at 12pm)\nBefore class, you’ll complete Preview Activities which will guide you through your first contact with new concepts.\nThese will involve readings, videos, along with exercises to build your basic skill fluency. For example, you might be asked to read a chapter from the course textbook, watch a few videos discussing some concepts from the chapter, and then asked to complete some preliminary exercises intended to get you started thinking about how to apply the concepts from the chapter in the context of real data.\nYou’ll submit these exercises online, so that class time can be customized based on your understanding.\n\n\nPractice Activities\nDue Wednesdays at midnight\nDuring class, you’ll be working with your classmates to complete Practice Activities, which take your Preview Activities a step further. You will collaborate with your team to solve a puzzle, requiring that you accomplish a series of tasks, each of which applies the statistical computing concepts from that week. The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost.\nThe course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the activity.\n\n\nLab Assignments\nDue Sundays at midnight\nAfter class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you’ve learned. If you got something wrong, don’t worry! You’ll have a chance to try again.\nLabs will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Lab Assignments will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment.\n\n\nChallenges\nDue Sundays at midnight\nEach Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem, which asks you to extend the skills you’ve learned in class in some way. Frequently, you have the choice of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\nAlthough you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text absolutely must be your own.\nChallenges will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Challenges will be submitted to the same Canvas portal as the original assignment.",

Instead of using a “grace day”, you choose to copy the assignment into ChatGPT and ask it to write code to accomplish the tasks. ChatGPT spits out code with a style/format different from what we learned in class; you copy it into your Quarto code chunks and it runs so you render your assignment and turn it in anyway.

Over the course of the quarter you will work with many different people. Each of these people can be a resource for you and you can be a resource for them!\nI encourage you to establish study buddies and / or study groups early in the quarter, even if you don’t know anyone yet. The class Discord server is a great way to get started. I also hope you will be proactive about setting up your own video chat sessions, phone calls, Google Docs, group chats, etc. (How many different platforms can you talk about Stat 331 on? Facebook? Snapchat? Instagram? TikTok? Bumble???)\nI hope that we will all be purposeful and creative about finding ways to work as a team.",

Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click “Ok” until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of July 1, 2024 was R-4.4.1 (Race for Your Life).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you’re going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

Unlike other graphics classification schemes, the grammar of graphics makes an attempt to describe how the data set itself relates to the components of the chart.\nThis has a few advantages:\n\nIt’s relatively easy to represent the same data set with different types of plots (and to find their strengths and weaknesses)\nGrammar leads to a concise description of the plot and its contents\nWe can add layers to modify the graphics, each with their own basic grammar (just like we combine sentences and clauses to build a rich, descriptive paragraph)\n\n\n\n\nA pyramid view of the major components of the grammar of graphics, with data as the base, aesthetics building on data, scales building on aesthetics, geometric objects, statistics, facets, and the coordinate system at the top of the pyramid.

Please complete the following evaluation form, which aims to assess the lecturer’s performance. Only one answer should be indicated for each question. The answers are coded in the following way: 5 - I strongly agree; 4 - I agree; 3 - Neutral; 2 - I don’t agree; 1 - I strongly don’t agree.\nQuestion 1: I learned a lot during the course.\nQuestion 2: I think that the knowledge acquired during the course is very useful.\nQuestion 3: The professor used activities to make the class more engaging.\nQuestion 4: If it was possible, I would enroll for a course conducted by this lecturer again.\nQuestion 5: The classes started on time.\nQuestion 6: The lecturer always used time efficiently.\nQuestion 7: The lecturer delivered the class content in an understandable and efficient way.\nQuestion 8: The lecturer was available when we had doubts.\nQuestion 9. The lecturer treated all students equally regardless of their race, background and ethnicity.\n\nThese data are from the end of the winter semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. In the period of data collection, all university classes were entirely online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While expected learning outcomes were not changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could have implications for data.\nAverage SET scores were combined with many other variables, including:\n\ncharacteristics of the teacher (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in the past 6 semesters).\ncharacteristics of the course (time of day, day of the week, course type, course breadth, class duration, class size).\npercentage of students providing SET feedback.\ncourse grades (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the current course and previous 6 semesters).\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new hypotheses.\nBefore tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable included in the teacher_evals_codebook.pdf inside the “resources” folder.\n1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis.\n\n# code chunk for loading packages\n\n2. Load in the teacher_evals data.

You do not need to show any code for this question, although you probably want to use code to get some information about the data (e.g., summary(data), glimpse(data), dim(data), etc.). Things to think about – where did the data come from? what sort of data are provided (context and data type)? how much data do you have? etc.\n\n\n\n# you may want to use code to answer this question\n\n4.

    "text": "Plagiarism in Programming\nPart of learning to program is learning from a variety of resources. Thus, I expect you will use resources that you find on the internet. There is, however, an important balance between copying someone else’s code and using their code to learn. Therefore, if you use external resources, I want to know about it.\n\nIf you used Google, you are expected to “inform” me of any resources you used by pasting the link to the resource in a code comment next to where you used that resource.\nIf you used ChatGPT, you are expected to “inform” me of the assistance you received by (1) indicating somewhere in the problem that you used ChatGPT (e.g., below the question prompt or as a code comment), and (2) downloading and attaching the .txt file containing your entire conversation with ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, you are permitted and encouraged to work with your peers as you complete lab assignments, but you are expected to do your own work. Copying from each other is cheating, and letting people copy from you is also cheating. Please don’t do either of those things."
