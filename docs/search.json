When I grade your Lab and Challenge assignments, I will mark each problem with an S, a G, or an N. You will have the option to retry any Learning Targets for which you scored a G or an N on. When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—I need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nIf your revisions do not include reflections by the deadline, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from my STAT 313 course, but I think you’ll get the idea.\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.\n\nIt is my goal to have your lab and challenge assignments (which are due on Sunday night) back to you no later than Thursday, so we can spend time talking about the revisions during class. You will then have until the following Friday to complete your revisions on the problems you received a G or an N on.",

    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers. \n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question. \n\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others. \nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two “roles”—recorder and listener. We will discuss these roles in class, but here are some rough descriptions of the scope of each role:\n\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else’s code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing “tidy” and “efficient” code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone’s code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other.",

This included the R code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.\nIn this class the assumed knowledge is the course materials, including the course textbook, coursework pages, and course slides. Any functions / code used outside of these materials require direct references. This includes any functions learned through R documentation for functions we have learned. Meaning, if you look up the help file for mutate() and you learn about a function not covered in the course materials, you are required to cite the documentation when using that function.\nEven inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another’s work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. If you are struggling with writing the R code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!\nAny incident of dishonesty, copying or plagiarism will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Cheating or plagiarism will earn you a grade of 0 on the assignment and will remove your ability to submit revisions for that assignment.\nIf you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.",

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. [This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn’t play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nIn this class, we will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na “Stat 331” folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 331\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)\na separate R Studio Project (and GitHub repository) associated with each assignment\n\nFor example, if you come to my office for help on your lab assignment for Week 2, I would expect your files to look like this:\n\nFile Storage on WindowsFile Storage on a Mac\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.”\n\nInside my STAT 331 folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.” You can tell what folders Lab 1 lives inside based on the information included at the top of the screen. This is called a “file path,” which tells your computer where a folder / file lives on the computer.\nOn a PC, every file lives on the C Drive, so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\nC:/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1\n\n\n\nI have six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.” Inside this folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.”\nOn a Mac, every file lives on the hard drive (it doesn’t have letters like a PC), so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\n/Users/atheobold/Documents/STAT 331/Week 1/Lab 1",

You can assume unequal variances and a two-sided alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction Documentation\n\n\n\nLook up the help documentation for t.test() for directions on how your inputs should look.

We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

I design all my courses with accessibility at the forefront of my thinking, but if you have any suggestions for ways I can make things more accessible, please let me know. Come talk to me if you need accommodation for your disabilities. I honor self-diagnosis: let’s talk to each other about how we can make the course as accessible as possible. See also the standard syllabus statements, which include more information about formal processes.\n\n\nI’m having difficulty paying for food and rent, what can I do?\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in the course, I urge you to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.\n\n\nMy mental health is impairing my ability to engage in my classes, what should I do?\nNational surveys of college students have consistently found that stress, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, interpersonal concerns, death of a significant other and alcohol use are among the top ten health impediments to academic performance. If you are experiencing any mental health issues, I and Cal Poly are here to help you. Cal Poly’s Counseling Services (805-756-2511) is a free and confidential resource for assistance, support and advocacy.\n\n\nSomeone is threatening me, what can I do?\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. I will help you get the help you need. I commit to changing campus culture that responds poorly to dating violence and stalking.\n\n\nWhat if I can’t arrange for childcare?\nIf you are responsible for childcare on short notice, you are welcome to bring children to class with you. If you are a lactating parent, you many take breaks to feed your infant or express milk as needed. If I can support yo in navigating parenting, coursework, and other obligations in any way, please let me know.",

The designer is then tasked with instructing the players how to replicate the design they created, but there are some rules.\n\nThe designer cannot touch the players shapes.\nThe designer cannot tell the players how to assemble the shapes into the correct design.\nThe designer can respond to questions posed by the players.\n\n\n\nPlayers\n“Players” are tasked with solving the design made by the “designer.” Players can pose questions to the designer to uncover their design. Once an player believes they have figured out the design, the designer should check their solution. If the designer says the solution is correct, then the player can assist the designer in answering questions posed by the other players.\n\n\nObserver\nThe “observer” is tasked with monitoring the interactions between the designer and the players. Specifically, the observer should check off the number of times they see two behaviors occurring, (1) explaining by telling how, and (2) everybody helps. The observer should have a scoring sheet to tally the number of times they see each behavior."

However, there are a few additional rules to keep things fun:\n\nThis exercise must be done in complete silence. No talking is permitted.\nYou may not point or signal to other players with your hands in any way.\nEach player must put together their own circle. No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces—one at a time—to any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you. As per the previous rule, you may not place a piece in another person’s puzzle; players must complete their own puzzle. Instead, you are expected to hand the piece to the other player."

The idea of a “base folder” or starting place was introduced as a working directory. In R, there are two ways to set up your file path and file system organization:\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory in R (do not reccommend)\nUse RProjects (preferred!)\n\n\nWorking Directories in R\nTo find where your working directory is in R, you can either look at the top of your console or type getwd() into your console.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/atheobol/Documents/Current Research/IUSE/groupworthy-data-science/weeks\"\n\n\nAlthough it is not recommended, you can set your working directory in R with setwd():\n\nsetwd(\"/path/to/my/assignment/folder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths in R\n\n\n\nA quick warning on file paths is that Mac / Linux and Windows differ in the direction of their backslash to separate folder locations. Mac/Linux use / (e.g. STAT331/Week1) while Window’s uses \\ (e.g. STAT331\\Week1).\n\n\n\n\nRprojects"

That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Code to carry out steps 10-15\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\nHint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\n# Code for steps 16-18\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector"

The RProject lives in this folder for two reasons, (1) when you copied the Lab 1 GitHub repository you told RStudio you wanted to make a new RProject, and (2) in order for RStudio to talk with GitHub you need to use an RProject.\nHowever, if you look at your STAT331 folder, you should not see a blue cube since we never created an RProject in this folder. Let’s do that now!\nTo add a Rproject to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already created a folder for this class), first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\nNavigation prompt for creating a new RProject in an existing directory\n\n\nThen, browse on your computer to where you saved your STAT331 folder last week. This should be in your Documents folder, similar to where mine is saved!\n\n\n\nNavigation prompt for selecting which existing folder in which the RProject should be created.\n\n\nOnce you click “Create Project”, your existing folder, STAT331 should now contain a STAT331.Rproj file. This is your new “home” base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path it will begin to look for it here.",
