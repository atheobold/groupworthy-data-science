## Once You're Finished

At the end of the task, your group will have one completed 
Quarto document and one rendered HTML, containing your groups’
worked-out solutions and justifications. **Everyone** must take
turns writing the final product (as described above) and 
**everyone** must be able to explain every line of code in your
final document.
