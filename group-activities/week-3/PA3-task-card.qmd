## Dealing with Errors

As you work through this PA, you will encounter some code that does not work as
you want it to. Don't despair! **Errors** (when R is unable to run your code)
and **bugs** (when the code doesn't do what you hoped) are a natural part of
coding. Even the best of the best deal with these problems regularly - learning
to track down the issue is a skill that you can learn and practice.

**Errors can be sneaky - check results *often*!**

If a chunk of code runs smoothly without giving you an error or warning this
**does not** necessarily mean it accomplished the desired task.

It is a good habit to check the results of your code **every time** you finish a
task. In general, I would recommend completing the following tasks
**every time** you write a code chunk.

-   Include a comment at the beginning of the code chunk that briefly states the
purpose of the chunk. Comments in the code chunks come after `#` signs. These
comments will remind later readers---which might be your future self!---what the
desired output of the code chunk is.

-   If you created a new object, take a look at it! You can inspect the object
by either clicking its name in your *Environment* tab or by typing its name into
the console. Make sure it looks about how you expect. **Do not** type code to
inspect the object in your Quarto file, as that **is not** code that needs to be
saved!

-   If you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you
hoped. Use the *Environment* or the `head()` function to investigate your
changes.

**Google is your friend!**

<!-- Some tricks: -->

<!-- -   Copy-paste the exact error message into Google. Chances are, somebody else -->
<!-- had a similar problem and got a similar message. -->

<!-- -   Include package names in your search terms. For example, "bar plot in -->
<!-- ggplot" is a better search than "bar plot in R". -->
