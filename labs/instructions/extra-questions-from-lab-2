But wait, the `aov()` output doesnâ€™t actually tell us **which** species differ! Install the `emmeans` package by running `install.packages("emmeans")` in your console (NOT in the .qmd file). Then, run the code chunk below to load the package.

```{r}
#| label: mcp-package

library(emmeans)
```

Look up the help documentation for `emmeans()`. This one might take a bit of Google-ing. Note that we conducted a *one-factor model*.

**19. Using the `species_mod` from above and the `emmeans()` function, complete the code below to obtain estimated model mean rodent weights for each species**

```{r}
#| label: mean-weights-by-species

species_estimates <- emmeans()

species_estimates
```

**20. Now that you have obtained the estimated model mean rodent weights, conduct pairwise comparisons using the `pairs()` function from the `emmeans` package.**

```{r}
#| label: pairwise-comparisons
  
```
