# Data Context

![](images/penguins-docs.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the R documentation page for the penguins dataset. The documentation page describes the context of the data (body measurements of penguins from the Palmer Archipeligo of Antarctica), the variables included in the data (species, island, bill_length_mm, etc.), and the units for each variable."} **What variables are included in these data? What units are the variables measured in? What do you think each row in the data represents?**

# Grammar of Graphics

Think of a graph or a data visualization as a mapping...

...**FROM variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data)...

...**TO visual attributes** (or "aesthetics") **of marks** (or "geometric elements") on the page/screen.

## How to Build a Graphic with `ggplot2`

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(data = penguins)
```

**What do you expect to see after running this code?**

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)
       )
