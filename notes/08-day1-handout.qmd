| Issue | Fix | Function(s) to Use |
|----|----|----|
| The name of the  `data-variable` (e.g., `col_var`) isn't injected into the `environment-variable` (e.g., `df`). |  |  |
| My function uses two arguments, but only one of them is absolutely necessary. |  |  |
| The inputs to a function are quoted (e.g., `c("species", "island")` when the function expects unquoted variable names. |  |  |
| I want to include an argument that is optional and I want to specify a default value for it. |  |  |
