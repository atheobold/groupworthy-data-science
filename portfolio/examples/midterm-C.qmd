#| label: r-2-1

# Lab 2 question 4
ggplot(data = surveys, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  labs(
    title = "relationship between weight and hindfoot_length of different species",
    subtitle = "y-axis representing hindfoot_length (mm)",
    x = "weight (g)",  # x-axis label
    y = ""
  )

```

-   Example of **dplyr** pipeline

  filter(average_student_failing >= max(average_student_failing) | average_student_failing <= min(average_student_failing)) |>
  select(teacher_id, average_student_failing)

```

-   using a single function call with multiple inputs (rather than multiple function calls)

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-one-call

# Lab 3 Question 9
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  count(course_id, teacher_id) |>
  filter(n == 9) |>
  nrow()
```

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-across

# Lab 3 question 5
teacher_evals_clean <- teacher_evals |> 
  rename(sex = gender) |>
  filter(no_participants > 10) |> 
  mutate(
    across(.cols = c(teacher_id:class_duration), as.numeric)
  ) |> 
  select(course_id:SET_score_avg, percent_failed, academic_degree, seniority, sex)
```

-   `map()` functions

```{r}
#| label: pe-1-map-1


```

**PE-2: I can write functions to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   Function that operates on vectors

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-1


```

-   Function that operates on data frames

```{r}
#| label: pe-2-2


```

**PE-3:I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.**

-   `across()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-across

```

-   `map()` function with **one** input (e.g., `map()`, `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, etc.)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-1

```

-   `map()` function with **more than one** input (e.g., `map_2()` or `pmap()`)

```{r}
#| label: pe-3-map-2

```

**PE-4: I can use modern tools when carrying out my analysis.**

-   I can use functions which are not superseded or deprecated

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-1

# Lab 3 quetsion 7
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))
```

-   I can connect a data wrangling pipeline into a `ggplot()`

```{r}
#| label: pe-4-2

# Lab 4 question 6
ca_childcare |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = mc_infant:mc_preschool,
               names_to = "study_group",
               values_to = "median_amount") |>
  select(study_year, study_group, median_amount, region) |>
  mutate(study_group = str_to_title(str_remove(study_group, "mc_")),
         study_group = fct_relevel(study_group, "Infant", "Toddler", "Preschool")) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = study_year,
                       y = median_amount,
                       color = fct_reorder2(region, study_year, median_amount))) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~study_group) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(
    x = "Study Year",
    y = "",
    title = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare ($)",
    color = "California Region"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Data Simulation & Statisical Models

**DSSM-1: I can simulate data from a *variety* of probability models.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-1

```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dsm-1-2

```

**DSSM-2: I can conduct common statistical analyses in R.**

-   Example 1

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-1

# Lab 1 question 9

# Load the ToothGrowth dataset (should be available in base R)
data(ToothGrowth)

# Perform the two-sample t-test with unequal variances (Welch's t-test)
t_test_result <- t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth, 
                        var.equal = FALSE, 
                        alternative = "two.sided")

# Print the result
print(t_test_result)
```

-   Example 2

```{r}
#| label: dsm-2-2


# Lab 2 Question 17
species_mod <- aov(weight ~ species, data = surveys)

summary(species_mod)

```

## Revising My Thinking

<!-- How did you revise your thinking throughout the course? How did you revise your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

<!-- For the revisions included in your Portfolio, to help me understand the nature of your revisions, please denote somehow the feedback I provided you (e.g., boldface, italics, colored text) before your revisions. -->

Throughout the course, I would always take the feedback from Dr. Theobold and my peer and try to make each and every question from growing to successful, while also providing reflections of the changes. For majority of my labs and challenges, I have turned in a revision no matter if I have already received a "complete" on that assignment.

Example:

The following code was modified from the original to be clearer and more efficient from my past labs.

```{r}
teacher_evals_clean |> 
  count(course_id, teacher_id) |>
  filter(n == 9) |>
  nrow()
```

Comment I got from my revision:

**Comments:**

This requires far fewer steps!

## Extending My Thinking

<!-- How did you extended your thinking throughout the course? How did you extend your thinking on the code examples you have provided in your portfolio? -->

I always used what I learned from my past labs and practice activities in future assignments. For example, I would always use the pipe ("\|\>") whenever we have a one directional data flow. In addition, I would always complete the challenges to the best of my ability with everything I have learn thus far. I sometimes try to go above and beyond the class and use resources that were not taught but can be found on online documentations (but also citing them) and learning about them.

## Peer Support & Collaboration

<!-- Include an image or a description of feedback you gave that you are proud of (either in a peer review or in Discord). -->

The following is the feedback that I gave that I'm most proud of in one of my peer review. I included an in-depth review of my peer's general code formatting. I also gave some suggestions on how to write more tidy codes like `adding more spaces between "=" and adding more return statements after ","` .

<!-- Include a description of how you grew as a collaborator through the weekly pair programming activities.   -->

Before my discussion with Dr. Theobold, I didn’t fully understand the Developer/Coder protocol established for our team. My collaboration with my partner was largely one-sided—I often took the lead, typing out solutions and implementing my ideas without much input from them. This approach limited my partner’s opportunities to engage and grow as a developer. After our conversation, I made a conscious effort to alternate roles more consistently, ensuring we both contributed by actively listening, discussing, and sharing our ideas as Developers and Coders. This shift allowed for a more balanced and productive collaboration.
