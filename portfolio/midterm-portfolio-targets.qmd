# Learning Targets

The following learning targets have been covered in Weeks 1-5 of this course. When locating code that "fits" into these learning targets I would like for you to:

-   find 1-2 **high quality** examples (quality \> quantity)
-   find examples that hit on **multiple** learning targets at the same time

For example, the code below could be used to demonstrate proficiency
with: 

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- WD-2 -- in two places (`select()` and `starts_with()`)!
- WD-7
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- WD-4
- R-2 (tidy code)
- PE-4 (the `|>` is a "modern tool")

:::
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: example-student-code

ca_childcare |>
  select(study_year,
         mc_infant,
         mc_toddler,
         mc_preschool,
         region
         ) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("mc_"), 
               names_to = "age", 
               values_to = "median_income"
               ) |> 
  mutate(age = fct_relevel(age, 
                          "mc_infant",
                          "mc_toddler",
                          "mc_preschool")
        )
```


:::::::::: columns
::::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #34605f;"}
Working with Data
:::

-   **WD-1**: I can import data from a variety of formats (e.g., csv, xlsx, txt)
-   **WD-2**: I can select necessary columns from a dataset
-   **WD-3**: I can filter rows from a dataset for a variety of data types (e.g., numeric, factor, date, character)
-   **WD-4**: I can modify existing variables and create new variables in a dataset for a variety of data types (e.g., numeric, factor, date, character)
-   **WD-5**: I can use mutating joins from the `tidyr` package to combine multiple datasets
-   **WD-6**: I can use filtering joins from the `dplyr` package to filter rows from a dataset
-   **WD-7**: I can pivot datasets from long to wide and visa versa

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #34605f;"}
Reproducibility
:::

-   **R-1**: I can create professional looking, reproducible analyses using RStudio projects, Quarto documents, and the `here` package <!-- we will want to add a target about file structure --> <!-- we will want to add a target about version control -->
-   **R-2**: I can write well documented[^1] and tidy code[^2]
    + You have not written functions yet, so you will not have any content for the "Example of function formatting" code block. 
-   **R-3**: I can write robust programs[^3] that are resistant to changes in inputs
    + You have not written functions yet, so you will not have any content for the "Example of function stops" code block. 
:::::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #34605f;"}
Data Visualization & Summarization
:::

-   **DVS-1**: I can create visualizations for a variety of variable types (e.g., numeric, character, date)
-   **DVS-2**: I use plot modifications to make my visualizations clearer to the reader
-   **DVS-3**: I show creativity in my visualizations
-   **DVS-4**: I can calculate numerical summaries of variables
-   **DVS-5**: I can calculate numerical summaries of variables across multiple groups
-   **DVS-6**: I can create tables which make my summaries clear to the reader

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #34605f;"}
Program Efficiency
:::

-   **PE-1**: I can write concise code which does not repeat itself.
    + You have not yet learned about iteration, so you will not have any content for the "`map()` functions" code block. 
- **PE-3:** I can use iteration to reduce repetition in my code.
    + You have not yet learned about iteration, so you will not have any content for the code blocks related to the `map()` function.  
-   **PE-4**: I can use modern tools[^4] when carrying out my analysis.

Data Simulation & Statistical Models
:::

-   **DSSM-2**: I can conduct common statistical analyses in R
:::::
::::::::::

[^1]: "well documented" code has elements of the following:

    -   code comments (e.g., \# function to rescale columns between 0 and 1)

    -   code chunk names (using the `#| lab:` option)

    -   sections in Quarto file which describe the process(es) being implemented

[^2]: "tidy code" is code which adheres to the tidyverse style guidelines

[^3]: The follow are some examples of code I would consider "robust":

    -   using column names rather than column positions

    -   including function stops when writing functions

    -   using processes that don't depend on you remembering a particular sequence of steps (e.g., `arrange()` then `slice()` versus `slice_max()`)

[^4]: **The following are some examples of tools I would consider are "modern":**

    -   functions which are not superseded

    -   functions which are not deprecated

    -   using the pipe operator to decrease the number of intermediate objects created

# Grade Guidelines

The following are the expectations for each letter grade, as written (and voted on) by you. When making an argument for your grade, your rationale should be based on these criteria rather than vague statements about the work you have done thus far (e.g., "I'd worked really hard each week to accomplish the assignments.").
