## What is the Portfolio and how will it be used?

A **portfolio** is a collection of work that gives information about the person
doing the work. Artists and architects, for example, have portfolios that show
the range and scope of what they do, and by looking through their portfolios,
you get a sense of who this person is, how they have grown as a professional,
what they have produced, and what they are capable of producing.

That’s the spirit intended for the STAT 331 Portfolio. In your portfolio, you
will give a curated collection of your best work along with reflections that
tell the story of your growth from the first day of classes all the way to the
end. **Your goal is to argue, convincingly and with concrete evidence, that you
have met the criteria for both content mastery, evidence of continued learning,
and growth as a team member that goes with a particular grade.** I will read
your portfolio carefully, and if you make a convincing case for a grade, that’s
the grade you’ll receive.

## Key information

**Format:** You’ll put all of your work — both the artifacts of past work and
the responses to the writing prompts — into **one** GitHub repository. If you
choose for this repository to be public, you only need to provide me with the 
link to the repo. If you choose for this repository to be private, you will need
to add me as a collaborator to your repo.

**Template:** Here is a template repository you can use to guide how you should organize your portfolio: <https://github.com/atheobold/STAT331_portfolio_template>

**Due date:** The portfolio is due **the Saturday before finals week**. No
deadline extensions are available for the Final Portfolio.

**What to include**: Your portfolio needs to contain all of the following:

-   **Final grade reflection**: this is a document housing examples of code
you've written which demonstrate your achievement of the course's learning
objectives, reflections about how you revised your thinking throughout the
course, examples of how you extended your thinking, and reflections and examples
of how you grew as a collaborator. 

-   **Supporting artifacts** -- These are all of the assignments you reference
in your final grade reflection. You are able to use **any** Lab or Challenge
assignment submitted, but please keep these focused, and be selective.

-   **Essay responses**. Write brief responses to each of the essay prompts listed below under **Essays**. Put each essay response on its own page. (All of the "Lightning Round" responses should go on the same page, however.)\

## Final grade reflection

This component is a self-evaluation of your performance in the class. Your goal
is **to state clearly what grade you think you have earned in the course, and
convincingly argue that you have met the criteria for that grade.** Please be
thoughtful, honest, and reflective, but also brief and focused.

This reflection will be done in the `reflection_template.qmd` file provided in
the repository. The structure of the document is as follows:

1.  **What grade did you earn?** State it clearly in one sentence. You can
include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.

2.  For each of the learning targets, carefully select examples of your code
that demonstrate concretely and directly your proficiency with the given target.

- Some learning targets ask for one example, some ask for two examples, and some ask for specific examples relative to particular data types.

- **Your Lab assignments and Challenge problems should be a primary source of these examples**, but you can also include other items. Anything that supports your
argument for a grade can be submitted.

- You must indicate where the code you provided came from, including the title
of the assignment and problem number either next to the code title (e.g., xlsx
- Lab 2 Question 1) or as a code comment at the top of the code chunk. 

- Note, your code is not expected to run! The execute options at the top of the
Quarto file are set to `eval: false`. Thus, you **do not** need to load in any
packages or datasets in your reflection.

3.  **How did you meet that grade’s requirements?** The requirements for grades
are found in the [course syllabus](/course-materials/course-syllabus.qmd)
section of the syllabus. Review the criteria carefully. Then, explain how you
have satisfied the criteria for the grade you are saying you’ve earned. Be
specific and thorough. List each criterion you have met and how you know you’ve
met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in the Portfolio that support
your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the
criteria have been met.

4.  **What else?** There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade
request that isn’t explicitly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria
you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade
determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide
evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus criteria, be
focused, specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide
evidence.

**Plus/minus grades:** You may argue to add a "+" or "-" modifier to your grade.
Generally speaking a "+" added to a letter grade means you’ve met all the
criteria for the letter grade along with a significant amount, but not all, of
the criteria for the next letter grade up. And a "-" means that you have met the
requirements for a letter grade but only in a way that you believe is a bare
minimum, or you’ve met almost all the requirements for the letter grade except
for a small number of **minor** criteria.

## Revisions

You can revise any Lab Assignment or Challenge one additional time before including it in the portfolio. If you do so, please note:

-   **Do not submit the revised Lab Assignment or Challenge to Canvas.** Just put the revision in the Portfolio.

-   If you chose to complete an additional revision for the Portfolio, please indicate this to me. For example in the reference to the code location, indicate a revision has been made (e.g., right_join() - Challenge 4 (Revised))

-   **You won’t get any additional feedback for revisions done for the Portfolio.** If you want feedback on a solution, submit it as an ordinary homework revision.

## **Essays**

In your Portfolio repository, there is a folder labeled `essays` which includes
three separate `.qmd` files. You are expected to address the essay prompt(s) in 
each file. 

-   **Growth as a data scientist**: Describe how you have improved as a
practitioner and student of data science this quarter through your work in the
course. Focus specifically on data science concepts and the skills we employed
in learning them. Don’t just give a laundry list of topics that you learned
(those are in the syllabus, so we know them already). Focus instead on a small
number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STAT 331. Identify
at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth.
Explain in this essay how this artifact shows growth in the way you are
describing.

-   **The power of efficiency**: As we’ve said in the class efficiency is a
pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay,
give an explanation of what that term "efficiency" means in relation to
statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency
and understood its importance. Include: What is the definition of "efficiency"?
What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science? What
does efficiency allow you to do? Why is efficiency important? Where did you
encounter efficiency, and what were some ["a-ha" moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the
portfolio.)

-   **Lightning round**: Answer each of the following questions with 
**one sentence** including a brief explanation.

    + Finish the sentence with another student’s name: "If \[Student\] doesn’t 
    earn an A, then nobody should, because…" Explain your choice and your
    reasoning.

    + What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, 
    a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.

    + What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.

    + What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.

    + Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a quarter of STAT 331 
    that will help them be successful in learning.

## About time and effort

As your instructor, I understand and respect that you have spent a great deal of
time and effort on this course and will probably continue to do so until the end
of the quarter. It’s possible that STAT 331 has been the most challenging course
on your schedule this quarter, perhaps in your entire college career so far. I
want you to know that I see you, I respect your efforts, and it’s extremely 
fulfilling to see you respond to the challenges and grow.

I also want to be clear that while the time and effort spent on the class are
vitally important, they are not explicitly part of the grade criteria you find
in the syllabus. So, when you make the case for your grade in the portfolio, **I
respectfully ask that you keep your argument focused on concrete evidence of
understanding of the learning targets and engagement with the class**.

You are free to discuss your investment in time and effort in the essay
questions if you like, or apart from the portfolio if that makes more sense. But
**when making the case for your grade, the focus needs to be on the results of
your investment of time and effort**. Did your efforts result in several
exemplary solutions through the quarter? If so, put a subset of them in the
Portfolio. Did the time you spend on coursework result in being an engaged
collaborator during Practice Activities? If so, document how your efforts made
you a valuable group member.

## Questions you might have

### Q: What if you disagree with our final grade reflection?

#### A: There are two ways this might happen.

1.  You ask for a grade that is higher than the evidence supports. That is, you
grade yourself too highly, for example you believe you earned an A in the
course, but I do not feel the evidence you’ve provided supports this grade. If
this occurs in your Midterm Portfolio, **I will discuss this with you in your
5-minute Midterm Portfolio meeting**.I’ll tell you what grade I would have given
you based on the evidence you provided in the portfolio. You can then use this 
feedback when constructing your final portfolio.   If I believe the grade you’ve
proposed in your Final Portfolio does not reflect the evidence you’ve provided,
**I will discuss this with you in your 5-minute Final Portfolio meeting**. I’ll
tell you what grade I would have given you based on the evidence you provided in
the portfolio, and then give you the chance to provide additional evidence and
explanations for your grade request. In our meeting, if you still think your 
grade request is correct, you’ll have the chance to walk me through your 
materials and reasoning. Afterwards, I might agree with you. But if we still
disagree, we will try to come to an agreement on the highest grade that the
evidence supports. I have faith that we’ll be able to come to a
mutually-agreeable result. But, if we can’t, I will assign the grade that in my
estimation is the highest grade supported by the evidence, and my determination 
will be final. However, again, I will exhaust all other options before simply
overriding your grade determination.  

2. You ask for a grade that was lower than your actual performance indicates. 
That is, you "lowball" yourself, for example you say you earned a B when in fact
I think you earned an A-. In this case, I will award you the grade I think you
earned, and then just inform you that I’ve done so (and why).

**In my experience, the second situation happens significantly more frequently than the first.**

### Q: Is there a limit on the number of artifacts I can include to support my grade?

#### A: There is no strict limit, but **please be selective**. 

**Quality, not quantity** is what we are after. We do not want every assignment
in our portfolio! Typically you should be able to give a complete portfolio in
**fewer than 8 assignments** with judicious selection of homework solutions and
other work. A handful of homework solutions that clearly indicate your
attainment of the grade criteria is just as good as, if not better than, a
massive binder of mediocre examples.

### Q: How specific or detailed do I need to be on some of the criteria? For example, do I need to list all the dates when I answered someone’s question on Discord?

#### A: This isn’t filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work isn’t necessary. 

**Details and your reasoning are more important than precision and completeness
here.** For example if you made a handful of supportive comments in Discord,
pick a few and tell me about them. What was the question about? What did you
say? Why was that comment an example of "helpful feedback"? (Do you know that it
was helpful?) Remember the purpose is to **make a convincing case that you’ve
earned a particular grade.**

### Q: Would someone actually make a case that they earned a "D" in the class?

#### A: Yes, if the person is honest and there’s not enough evidence to make the case for a "C". 

If you’re in that situation, be honest and don’t overreach just because the consequences are significant.

### Q: How long should the essays be?

#### A: You should put serious effort into each of the essays and give thorough, detailed, and thoughtful responses — without going overboard and writing more than you need. 

There is no hard word or character count here, but if you are writing less than half a page using ordinary font and line spacing, then you probably need to spend more time carefully reflecting on the question; if you are writing more than two pages for a single essay, you might consider editing it down for clarity. As always, put yourself in the shoes of your readers and then use your judgment as a writer.

### Q: What if you do not submit a final portfolio?

#### A: If you do not complete a Final Portfolio submission, your grade will be at my discretion. 

I will use your Midterm Portfolio as well as completion of assignments from Week 7 - 10 to guide my decision.

**I’ll add more questions and answers in this space as they come up.**
