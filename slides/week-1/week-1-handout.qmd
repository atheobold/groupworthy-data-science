1.  What is the top of a Quarto document called? Where the options for the document are specified?

2.  How does Quarto know that a section of text is R code? What symbols is Quarto looking for?

3.  In an R code chunk, what does the `#|` do?

4.  What do each of these code chunk options do?

| Option      | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `echo`      |         |
| `eval`      |         |
| `message`   |         |
| `fig-align` |         |
| `fig-alt`   |         |
| `fig-cap`   |         |

5.  If you wanted **every** code chunk to have `warning: false` what should you do?\

6.  How do you make a section header in Markdown?\

7.  Can you save your file without rendering?\

8.  When you render does R use the code you already ran in RStudio? (i.e., the stuff saved in your Environment tab)
