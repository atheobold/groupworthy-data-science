# Group Programming Warm-up 

## [Broken Circles](../../group-activities/week-1/broken-circles.qmd)
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.small}
To set the stage for your future group collaborations, we will complete an 
activity that explores how working in groups can be more / less successful. 

Let's start by dividing the class into groups of 6 students.

![](images/broken-circles.JPG){fig-alt="An image of whit e circles with slices cut out. The pieces are labeled A, B, C, D, and E to indicate how they should be assembled to create a complete circle."}
:::
:::

## Activity Guidelines

1. No talking or other noises!
2. No pointing or hand signals!
3. No taking pieces. You may only give pieces to others.

**Your group is finished once [everyone]{.underline} has a complete circle.**

## Discussion 

- What do you think this game was about? What was its purpose?
- What did your group did that made you cooperate more successfully?
- What did your group did that made cooperation harder?
- What are some behaviors that could be implemented in the future to make
cooperation easier?

# A Data Puzzle

# A Data Puzzle

> Arrange the different pieces (tables and graphs) based on the actions that led
> to each new table / graph.

. . .

</br> 

Once you have arranged each of the tables and graphs, answer the following
questions:

1. What is the most common type of work location - remote or in-person? 
2. Does work location type vary by company size?

# Groupworthy Data Science

# Groupworthy Data Science

> The purpose of the study is to understand how an instructor's pedagogy impacts
> the equity of group collaborations, specifically as they relate to pair 
> programming. 

## Consent to Participate
