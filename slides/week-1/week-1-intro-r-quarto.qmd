## What does "ungrading" mean?

> "Ungrading is a pedagogical practice which entirely removes grades
as a focus of the course. Instead, ungrading exclusively focuses
on providing students with feedback aimed at helping them build
proficiency to accomplish the course’s learning goals."

## How does this system work?

::: {.incremental}
- Each problem on an assignment is marked for proficiency (e.g., success, 
growing). 
  + These marks are not attached to a grade outcome (e.g., A, B, C, D).

- Grades are defined from a set of criteria, co-developed between you and me. 
  + At the end of the course, you propose the grade you believe you’ve earned
  based on a portfolio of your work and the criteria we established.
:::


# Group Collaboration Activity

## [Broken Circles](../../group-activities/week-1/broken-circles.qmd)
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.small}
To set the stage for your future group collaborations, we will complete an 
activity that explores how working in groups can be more or less successful. 

Let's start by dividing the class into groups of 6 students. 
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
![](images/broken-circles.JPG){fig-alt="An image of whit e circles with slices cut out. The pieces are labeled A, B, C, D, and E to indicate how they should be assembled to create a complete circle."}
:::
:::

## Activity Guidelines

1. No talking or other noises!
2. No pointing or hand signals!
3. No taking pieces. You may only give pieces to others.

**Your group is finished once [everyone]{.underline} has a complete circle.**

## How did that feel?

. . .

What did you notice about how your group worked together?

What kinds of things helped your group finish?

## Collaboration Skills

Sometimes, you had to give away a piece without knowing if you’d get what you
needed in return. What was that like?

What helped you trust your teammates in those moments?

. . .

</br>

Was there a time when you gave up something you needed because you saw someone
else needed it more? Why did you make that choice?

. . .

</br>

What would have happened if everyone only thought about themselves?

<!-- The purpose of this activity wasn’t just to finish the circles—it was to practice what it means to work together. To succeed as a class, we’ll need to trust each other and look out for what other people need. Today was our first step. -->

# 10-minute Break

# Scripts + Notebooks

## 

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
**Scripts**

(`File > New File > R Script`) are files of code that are meant
to be run on their own.

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Notebooks**

allow you to integrate code, output, text, images, etc. into a single document
(e.g., Quarto documents, RMarkdown documents, Jupyter notebooks). 
:::
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
In this class, we will not be using R scripts. There are specific cases where 
scripts are preferred, which is covered in STAT 541 (in the spring!).
:::

## What is Quarto?

Quarto **unifies** and **extends** the RMarkdown ecosystem.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image displays a collection of hexagonal logos representing different R packages that are part of the R Markdown ecosystem. The logos from top to bottom, left to right, are: Xaringan, Distill, Blogdown, RMarkdown, Bookdown, Flexdashboard, Knitr, Rticles, RSConnect. These logos are arranged in a hexagonal shape, visually emphasizing the interconnected nature of these tools in the R Markdown ecosystem."
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_ecosystem.png")
```

Quarto files have the **.qmd** extension.

## Highlights of Quarto

-   Consistent implementation of attractive and handy features across outputs:

    -   E.g., tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc.

-   More accessible defaults and better support for accessibility.

-   Guardrails that are helpful when learning:

    -   E.g., YAML completion, informative syntax errors, etc.

-   Support for other languages like Python, Julia, Observable, and more.

## Quarto Formats

Quarto makes moving between outputs straightforward.

All that needs to change between these formats is a few lines in the front matter (YAML)!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Document**

``` yaml
title: "Lesson 1"
format: html
```

**Presentation**

``` yaml
title: "Lesson 1"
format: revealjs
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Website**

``` yaml
project:
  type: website

website: 
  navbar: 
    left:
      - lesson-1.qmd
```
:::

## Quarto Components

![](images/quarto_sections.jpeg){width="80%" fig-alt="The image shows a split-screen view of a Quarto document editor and the rendered output in a browser-like preview. On the left side, the code editor is displayed, and on the right side, the rendered HTML output of the document. On the left, the top section contains the front matter, which includes metadata about the document such as the title ('Hello, Quarto'), the format (HTML), and the editor (set to visual mode). Below this, there is an R code chunk where R packages are loaded (specifically, 'tidyverse' and 'palmerpenguins'). This section is marked with `{r`} at the beginning of the code chunk, and the chunk is labeled 'load-packages.' Some options, like 'include: false', are present to prevent this code from appearing in the final rendered output. Following the code is Markdown content, which includes text descriptions and headings such as 'Meet Quarto' and 'Meet the Penguins'. There are also inline code elements and hyperlinks, like a link to the Palmer Penguins dataset. On the right side of the image, the rendered output is displayed, showing formatted text and visuals. The title 'Hello, Quarto' is shown as a heading, followed by a description of Quarto and a section discussing penguins. A link to the Palmer Penguins dataset is included, along with a colorful illustration of three penguins representing different species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie). Below this text, a plot is displayed, showing the relationship between flipper length and bill length for these penguin species. This image highlights how Quarto documents combine code, Markdown, and front matter to create a dynamic and executable report."}

. . .

**How does Quarto know that a section of text should be interpreted as R code?**

## R Code Options in Quarto

**R code chunk** options are included at the top of each code chunk, prefaced with a `#|` (hashpipe).

These options control how the following code is run and reported in the final Quarto document.


## R Code Options in Quarto

<center>![](images/code_options.png){fig-alt="The image displays a table with two columns: 'Option' and 'Description.' It lists various options that can be used in code chunks within Quarto documents, along with their descriptions.The first option is 'eval,' which evaluates the code chunk. If 'false,' it only echoes the code into the output without executing it. The second option is 'echo,' which includes the source code in the output. Next is 'output,' which includes the results of executing the code in the output. The possible values for this option are 'true,' 'false,' or 'asis.' If set to 'asis,' the output will be in raw markdown and won't have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown. The 'warning' option includes warnings in the output. Lastly, the 'error' option includes errors in the output. It notes that enabling this option means errors while executing the code won't halt the document's processing."}</center>

## Chunk Option Completion in Quarto

<center>![](images/quarto_yaml_completion.png){fig-alt="The image demonstrates three different aspects of YAML code completion and diagnostics in Quarto. At the top, under the heading 'YAML completion for fields,' there is a code editor where the user is typing the beginning of an R chunk ('{r'). As they begin typing '#| e', a code completion menu appears suggesting YAML fields such as 'eval', 'echo', 'external', and 'error', among others. The highlighted field is `eval`, and a description in a yellow box appears, explaining that this option evaluates the code chunk, or, if set to 'false', it only echoes the code into the output. In the middle, under the heading 'YAML completion for options,' the code editor shows the 'eval' field typed out as '#| eval:'. As the user begins entering a value, a dropdown suggests the options 'true' and 'false' for the field, representing valid boolean options. At the bottom, under the heading 'YAML diagnostics for errors,' there is an example of an incorrect entry. The user has written '#| eval: FALSE' (with uppercase 'FALSE'), which leads to a red error indicator in the editor. A tooltip appears, pointing out the mistake and suggesting that the value should be lowercase 'false' instead. The image showcases how Quarto assists users with code completion, option suggestions, and real-time error diagnostics in the YAML section of code chunks."}</center>

## Global Code Chunk Options

Some R code options can also be included in the front matter (YAML) which would
be applied globally to the entire document.

``` yaml
title: "Lesson 1"
format: html
execute: 
  echo: true
  warning: false
```

## Global Code Chunk Options

<center>![](images/execution-options.png){fig-alt="The image displays a table with two columns: 'Option' and 'Description.' It lists various options that can be used in code chunks within Quarto documents, along with their descriptions.The first option is 'eval,' which evaluates the code chunk. If 'false,' it only echoes the code into the output without executing it. The second option is 'echo,' which includes the source code in the output. Next is 'output,' which includes the results of executing the code in the output. The possible values for this option are 'true,' 'false,' or 'asis.' If set to 'asis,' the output will be in raw markdown and won't have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown. The 'warning' option includes warnings in the output. Lastly, the 'error' option includes errors in the output. It notes that enabling this option means errors while executing the code won't halt the document's processing."}</center>

::: {.midi}
::: {.callout-tip}
In general, I would encourage you to **always** set the following global options:

- `echo: true`
- `warning: false`

## Quarto Documents Utilize Markdown Syntax 

**Markdown** is a *markup language*.

It uses special symbols and formatting to make pretty documents.

. . .

-   \*italics\* -- makes italics
-   \*\*bold\*\* -- makes bold text
-   \# -- makes headers
-   \![ ]( ) -- includes images or HTML links
-   < > -- embeds URLs

## Rendering your Quarto Document

To take your *.qmd* file and make it look pretty, you have to **render** it.

<center>

![](images/render.png){fig-alt="The image shows the toolbar from an RStudio or Quarto editor interface. At the top, it displays the filename 'hello.qmd' (indicating a Quarto Markdown file). There are several options visible in the toolbar, and a specific button labeled 'Render' is highlighted with a pink outline. This 'Render' button is used to generate the final output (such as HTML, PDF, or other formats) based on the Quarto document. Additionally, there is an option for 'Render on Save,' which allows automatic rendering whenever the document is saved. The toolbar also includes options for adjusting the view between 'Source' and 'Visual' modes, formatting tools, inserting content, and running code chunks. The image emphasizes the 'Render' function, which is essential for compiling and viewing the Quarto document's output."}

![](images/render_on_save.png){fig-alt="The image shows a toolbar from an RStudio or Quarto editor interface, similar to the previous one. At the top, the filename 'hello.qmd' is displayed, indicating the file being worked on is a Quarto Markdown document. In this image, the 'Render on Save' option is highlighted with a pink outline, indicating that it is selected or being emphasized. This feature automatically triggers rendering of the document every time it is saved, which is useful for seeing updates to the output in real-time without manually pressing the 'Render' button. In addition to the 'Render on Save' option, the toolbar also includes the 'Render' button, formatting tools, and options for switching between 'Source' and 'Visual' editing modes. Other options for running code chunks, adjusting formatting, and inserting elements are also visible, but the main focus here is on the 'Render on Save' functionality."}

</center>

<!-- ## Rendering your Quarto Document -->

<!-- Quarto CLI (command line interface) orchestrates each step of rendering: -->

<!-- 1.  Process the executable code chunks with either `knitr` or `jupyter`. -->
<!-- 2.  Convert the resulting Markdown file to the desired output. -->

<!-- ![](images/horst_qmd_render_schema.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the proecess of rendering a Quarto document. First the qmd is passed to knitr or jupyter, then it is passed to markdown, finally it's passed to pandoc, resulting in a PDF, Word, or HTML output file." width="50%" fig-align="center"} -->

## Rendering your Quarto Document

When you click **Render**:

::: {.incremental}
::: {.small}
1.    Your file is saved.
2.    The R code written in your *.qmd* file gets run **in order**.

  -   It starts from scratch, even if you previously ran some of the code in RStudio.
3.    A new file is created.

  -   If your Quarto file is called "Lab1.qmd", then a file called "Lab1.html" will be created.
  -   This will be saved in the same folder as "Lab1.qmd".
