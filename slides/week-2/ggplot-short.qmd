## Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics (GoG) is a principled way of specifying **exactly** how
to create a particular graph from a given data set. It helps us to 
systematically design new graphs.

. . .

<br>

Think of a graph or a data visualization as a mapping...

...**FROM variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data)...

...**TO visual attributes** (or "aesthetics") **of marks** (or "geometric elements") on the page/screen.

## How to Build a Graphic

Complete this template to build a basic graphic:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(
  data = <DATA>, 
  mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)
  ) +
  <GEOM FUNCTION>() + 
  any other arguments...
```

. . .

Notice, every `+` adds another **layer** to our graphic.

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
Notice that I'm using **named arguments** to make my code easier to read.

### Add data

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(data = penguins)
```

What do you expect to see after running this code?

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
#| label: blank-plot
#| fig-alt: "An image of a blank gray square representing a blank plotting canvas."

ggplot(data = penguins)
```
:::

### Add aesthetics

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)
       )
```

What do you expect to see after running this code?

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
#| label: add-variables-to-aesthetics
#| fig-alt: "An image of a gray square with white gridlines representing a plotting canvas where the variables have been assigned to the x and y aesthetics. On the x-axis there is a variable named 'class' with seven different values mapped to a particular white gridline---2seater, compact, midsize, minivan, pickup, subcompact, suv. On the y-axis there is a variable named 'hwy' with three printed values mapped to different white gridlines---20, 30, and 40. The spaces between these gridlines represent values between the printed values (e.g., 25)."


ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)
       )
```
:::

### Add one `geom` per layer

::: {.midi}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)
       ) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::


**What do you expect to see after running this code?**

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 4.5
#| fig-align: center
#| label: adding-jittered-points-and-boxplots
#| fig-alt: "The same visualization is presented, except there are not boxplots superimposed on top of the points (dots) for each vehicle type. The boxplots display the median (center line), quantiles (edges), and min / max (whiskers) of each vehicle's mileage."

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)
       ) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::
:::

## Aesthetics

We map **variables** (columns) from the data to **aesthetics** on the graphic using the `aes()` function.

What aesthetics can we set?

+ x, y
+ color, fill
+ linetype
+ shape
+ size

::: {.callout-tip}
See `ggplot2` cheat sheet for more!
:::

## Geometric Objects

Wee use a `geom_XXX()` function to represent data points.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.small}
**one variable**

+ `geom_density()`
+ `geom_bar()`
+ `geom_dotplot()`
+ `geom_histogram()`
+ `geom_boxplot()`
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.small}
**two variable**

+ `geom_point()`
+ `geom_line()`
:::
:::
::::

</br>

::: {.callout-tip}
See `ggplot2` cheat sheet for more!
:::

## Creating a Graphic

::: {.midi}
To create a specific type of graphic, we will **combine** aesthetics and
geometric objects. When sitting down to create a plot, it's great to start with
a **game plan**!
:::

. . .

::: {.midi}
1. What variables are you interested in?
2. What types of variables are these?
3. Where do you want to put each of these variables? (i.e., what `aes`thetics)
4. What type(s) of `geom`etries do you need?
:::

## How many penguins were captured on each island?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
1. What type of variable is `island`? 
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
2. What type of plot would you make for this type of variable?
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
3. What `geom` would you use to get this plot?
:::
:::

## What are the most common bill lengths for the penguins included in these data?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
1. What type of variable is `bill_length`? 
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
2. What type of plot would you make for this type of variable?
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
3. What `geom` would you use to get this plot?
:::
:::

## What is the relationship between a penguin's bill length and body mass?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
1. What type of variables are `bill_length` and `body_mass`? 
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
2. What type of plot would you make for these types of variables?
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
3. What `geom` would you use to get this plot?
:::
:::

## How would you recreate this plot?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: example-plot-with-colors-facets
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "Multiple scatterplots showing the relationship between penguins' bill length (on the x-axis) and their body mass (on the y-axis). There are separate plots for each species of penguin (Biscoe, Torgensen, Chinstrap) and different colors for male and female penguins within each plot."

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm, 
                     color = sex)
       ) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ island)
```

. . .

What additional code would you add to make the plot more clear?

1.  Think and work together. Do not divide the work.
2.  You are smarter together.
3.  Be open minded. 
4.  No cross-talk with other groups.
5.  Communicate with each other!

## Opening the Practice Activity in Google Colab

The partner whose family name starts first alphabetically starts as the
Developer! The Developer needs to:

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Click on the Practice Activity 2 link from Canvas
- Log-in to your Google account
- Make a copy of the Colab notebook
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
![](images/save-copy-colab.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the options provided when you click on the File pane within Google Colab. The option to save a copy in Drive is highlighted, to demonstrate how each student needs to make a copy of the notebook before sharing it with their partner." width=50%}

:::
:::

## Sharing with Your Partner

Once you have your copy, you need to:

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Share your copy with your partner's Google account
- Make sure the Coder can open the file
- The Developer should plug their laptop into the monitor
- The Coder should close their computer
- Get started! 
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
![](images/share-colab.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the options provided when you click on the Share pane (in the upper right corner) within Google Colab. The user has typed in a Gmail address to share it with Laura Smith, who will receive an email with a link to the document when the Notify option is checked." width=50%}
:::
:::

## Submission

- When you have completed the visualization tasks, you will work as a group to
answer the five questions posed at the end of the document. 

- Each person will input the answers to these questions in the PA2 Canvas quiz.
- The person who last occupied the role of Developer will print the notebook as 
a PDF and submit the PDF for the group.
  + Only one submission per group!
