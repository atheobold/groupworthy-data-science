# Piping

You can choose whether to:

declare your data as the first argument of the function

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: not-piped-data

filter(.data = colleges, REGION == 5) |>
  mutate(TUITION_DIFF = TUITIONFEE_OUT - TUITIONFEE_IN)
```

***or***

pipe your data into the first argument of the function

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: pipe-data

colleges |>
  filter(REGION == 5) |>
  mutate(TUITION_DIFF = TUITIONFEE_OUT - TUITIONFEE_IN)
```

# `filter`

> include **rows** based on one or more logical statements 

1. What symbol do you use to join two logical statements with an "or"?

2. What symbol do you use to join two logical statements with an "and"?


# `select`

> include **columns** based on one or more logical statements

3. What symbol do you use to **remove** a column from the dataset?


# `mutate()`

> create new columns or change existing columns

4. What are the three arguments of the `if_else()` function?

# `arrange()`

> Organize the rows of the data in order of a particular variable.

5. By default what order does the `arrange()` function put values in?

6. What can you add **inside** the `arrange()` function to change the default order?

# `arrange()` friends

7. What does the `n` argument of `slice_max()` and `slice_min()` do?

# `summarize`

> compute a table of summaries

8. What are common summary functions you might want to use?

# `group_by`

> put rows into groups based on values in column(s)

9. What happens when you group by **two** variables?
