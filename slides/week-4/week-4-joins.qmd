## Lab 3 Common Themes

::: {.midi}
::: {.incremental}
+ **Q1:** The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) package automatically loads `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`, etc. -- do not load these twice!

- **Q3:** Where did these data come from? How were they collected? What is the
context of these data?
  + **Challenge 3:** When reaching a conclusion with the hypothesis test, what
  does Question 3 refer to?
  
- Saving an f*$# load of objects 
  + Not outputting the results
:::
:::

## Lab 3 Common Themes

::: {.midi}
- **Q5 & Q7**: Not using the "correct" function syntax

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| label: correct-syntax-across
#| code-line-numbers: false

if_any(.cols = everything(), .fns = ~ is.na(.x))
```
:::

::: {.midi}
::: {.incremental}
- Not using `.x` to specify where the `.cols` input should go will go awry 
  when there are **multiple** function inputs. 
- Using named arguments (e.g., `.cols = `) makes your code more
readable and is part of the code formatting guidelines for this class. 

- Think about "efficient" ways to do things
  + **Q5**: Are you using the same function `across()` multiple columns?
  + **Q6**: Can you calculate multiple summary statistics in one pipeline?
  + **Q10-12**: Is there a way you can get **both** the max *and* min in one
  pipeline?
:::

# Lifecycle Stages

## Lifceycle Stages

As packages get updated, the functions and function arguments included in those packages will change.

+ The accepted syntax for a function may change.
+ A function/functionality may disappear.

![[Learn more about lifecycle stages](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html) of packages, functions, function arguments in R.](images/lifecycle.png){fig-alt="The image shows a flow diagram representing the lifecycle stages of a feature or process. It consists of four colored boxes with arrows connecting them. The green box in the center labeled stable is the main stage. To the left, an orange box labeled experimental has an arrow pointing toward stable, indicating that experimental features can progress to become stable. From stable, one arrow points upward to another orange box labeled deprecated, indicating that stable features can become deprecated. Another arrow points right to a dark blue box labeled superseded, showing that stable features can also be replaced or superseded."}


## Lifceycle Stages

<center>

![](images/summarize_lifecycle.png){width=70% fig-alt="The image shows the documentation for the summarise() (or summarize(), using the American spelling) function in R, commonly used in the dplyr package for data manipulation. The summarise() function is used to create summary statistics for data frames or tibbles. The key arguments include .data, which is the data frame or tibble input, and ..., which represents name-value pairs of summary functions. The .by and .groups arguments are optional and used to control grouping behavior in the summarization. A key point in the documentation is that returning values with size 0 or greater than 1 in summary functions, such as min(), n(), or sum(), was deprecated as of version 1.1.0. Instead, users are encouraged to use the reframe() function, which replaces the deprecated behavior. The lifecycle badge marks the deprecation of this feature, ensuring that users know that previous versions' behavior should be updated for compatibility with future versions of the package."}

</center>

## Deprecated Functions

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

military_clean <- military |> 
  anti_join(cont_region, 
            by = join_by(Country == Region))
```


::: {.small}
A **deprecated** functionality has a better alternative available and is scheduled for removal.

+ You get a warning telling you what to use instead.
:::

. . .

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| warning: true
#| message: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| eval: true

military_clean |> 
  filter(across(.cols = -Country, 
                .fns = ~ is.na(.x)
                )
         ) 
```
:::

## Deprecated Functions

::: {.small}
You **should not** use deprecated functions!

Instead, we use...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| eval: true

military_clean |>
  filter(if_all(.cols = -Country, 
                .fns = ~ is.na(.x)
                )
         ) 
```
:::

## Superceded Functions

A **superseded** functionality has a better alternative, but is not going away.

+ This is a softer alternative to deprecation.
+ A superseded function will not give a warning (since thereâ€™s no risk if you
keep using it), but the documentation will give you a recommendation for what
to use instead.

## Relational Data

When we work with multiple tables of data, we say we are working with
**relational data**.

+ It is the *relations*, not just the individual datasets, that are important.

. . .

When we work with relational data, we rely on **keys**.

-   A key uniquely identifies an observation in a dataset.
-   A key allows us to relate datasets to each other

## Childcare Costs

::: {.centered}

![](images/childcare-relations.jpg){fig-alt="A figure showing the relations between three different datasets: childcare_costs, counties, and ca_tax_revenue. The childcare_costs dataset has an arrow connecting the variable 'county_fips_code' to the 'county_fips' in the counties dataset. The counties dataset has an arrow connecting the 'county name' variable to the 'entity name' variable in the ca_tax_revenue dataset. Each of the arrows represents the keys (variables) that link each dataset." width=50%}

## Mutating Joins 

Add *variables* from a new dataframe to observations in an existing dataframe.

`inner_join()` 

`left_join()`   

`right_join()`  
 

## `inner_join()`

The 'x' table contains two columns: a key column with values 1, 2, and 3, and a value column with 'x1,' 'x2,' and 'x3.'

# Keys with different names

The "key" columns linking the `counties` and `ca_tax_rev` datasets have
different names. So, we need to use the `join_by()` function to link the names
together! Notice, `county_name` is the column from the `x` dataset (`counties`)
and `entity_name` is the column from the `y` dataset (`ca_tax_rev`). Order 
matters!

What if a county in `ca_tax_rev` doesn't have a match in `counties`?
:::

## `full_join()`

**Every county!** 

What if a there are counties that don't have matches?

:::


## Piping Joins

Remember: the dataset you pipe in becomes the **first argument** of the function you are piping into!

+ So if you are using a pipe, you will only be specifying the **right** (`x`) dataset inside the `join_XXX()` function.

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

left_join(x = counties, 
          y = ca_tax_rev, 
          by = join_by(county_name == entity_name)
          )
```

...is equivalent to...

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

counties |> 
  left_join(y = ca_tax_rev, 
            by = join_by(county_name == entity_name)
            )
```

## Lab 4 Preview: Joining Multiple Data Sets

Suppose we wanted to compare the taxes and costs of childcare for counties in 
California. To do this, we would need to join **all three** datasets together!

## Filtering Joins

## Filtering Joins: `anti_join()`
**Removes** observations when their keys are present in **both** datasets, and **only keeps variables from the first dataset**.

The left table has keys 1 (red), 2 (blue), 3 (green) paired with values x1, x2, x3. The right table has keys 1 (red), 2 (blue), and 4 (purple) paired with values y1, y2, y4. Lines indicate matching keys (1 and 2). The resulting table on the right contains only the rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right: key 3 with x3 (green). Keys 1 and 2 are excluded because they have matches in the right table."}

# Factor Variables

## What is a factor variable?

</br> 

In general, factors are used for: 

1. categorical variables with a fixed and known set of possible values.
  + E.g., `day_born` = Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, ..., Saturday
2. displaying character vectors in non-alphabetical order.

## California Counties

Let's consider the counties included in the `ca_tax_rev` data. I have randomly 
selected 25 counties for us to consider.

```{r}
#| echo: false

set.seed(2)

ca_tax_rev |> 
  distinct(entity_name) |> 
  slice_sample(n = 25)
```

## `forcats`

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
We use this package to...

+ turn character variables into factors

+ make factors by discretizing numeric variables

+ rename or reorder the levels of an existing factor
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image shows a hexagonal logo with a brown border featuring a group of black cats resting inside a cardboard box. The cats appear relaxed, laying on top of one another, with their eyes closed or half-open. The word forcats is written on the side of the box in a light brown color. This image represents the logo of the R package forcats, which is typically used for handling categorical variables (factors) in data analysis within the R programming environment."

## Creating a Factor -- `fct`

With `fct()`, the levels are automatically ordered in the **order of first appearance**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ca_tax_rev |> 
  pull(entity_name) |> 
  fct()
```

## Creating a Factor 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ca_tax_rev <- ca_tax_rev |> 
  mutate(entity_name = fct(entity_name))
```

::: {.midi}
::: {.callout-warning}
# To change a column type to factor, you must wrap `fct()` in a `mutate()` call.
:::
:::

. . .

</br> 

::: {.midi}
I am using `pull()` to display the outcome:

#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

ca_tax_rev |> 
  pull(entity_name)

:::

## Creating a Factor -- `fct`

::: {.midi}
You can **specify the order of the levels** with `level`.
:::

::: {.small}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| eval: false

                 "Riverside County", 
                 "San Bernardino County", 
                 "Santa Clara County",

                 "San Mateo County". 
                 ...
                 )
      )
```
:::

::: {.midi}
But that seems pretty tedious.
:::

## `fct_reorder()`

::: {.midi}
Often times, we want to reorder a factor based on the values of another 
variable. For example, we might want to reorder the CA counties based on their
mean sales taxes. 
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Code

::: {.midi}
```{r}
#| label: reorder-mutate
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| eval: false

ca_tax_rev <- ca_tax_rev |> 
  mutate(entity_name = fct_reorder(.f = entity_name,
                                   .x = sales_and_use_taxes,
                                   .fun = mean)
         )
```
:::

## Arguments

::: {.midi}
`.f`: the factor variable you want to reorder

`.x`: the variable you want to the reordering to be based on

`.fun`: the function you want to use when doing the reordering
:::
:::

## `fct_reoder()` with `ggplot()`

::: {.small}
The vast majority of the time we want to reorder a factor because we want our
visualization to look nicer. 
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

ca_tax_rev |> 
  filter(sales_and_use_taxes < quantile(sales_and_use_taxes, probs = 0.1)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sales_and_use_taxes, 
             y = fct_reorder(.f = entity_name,
                             .x = sales_and_use_taxes,
                             .fun = mean), 
             fill = entity_name)
         ) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Sales and Use Taxes",
       y = "") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar())
```

## `fct_reoder()` with `ggplot()`

::: {.small}
So, we could instead do this process **inside** `ggplot()`.

## Collapsing a Factor --`fct_collapse()`

Suppose we want to make a new variable that classifies the county based on its 
population: low, medium, and high. Here, we want to **collapse** existing
levels of a factor.

![](images/childcare-cost-map.png){fig-alt="The image is a color-coded map of the United States, showing the cost of childcare across different states. The map uses a gradient scale from light green (representing lower costs around $5,000) to dark blue (representing higher costs around $21,000). States with the most expensive childcare, such as Massachusetts ($21,019) and Washington, D.C. ($20,913), are shaded in dark blue, indicating the highest costs. States with lower costs, such as Mississippi ($5,436) and Alabama ($6,001), are shaded in light green. The map's data comes from the Economic Policy Institute, with the source indicated as Money Scoop, and was created using Datawrapper."}
