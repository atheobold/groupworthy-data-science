# Date + Time Variables

## Why are dates and times tricky?

When parsing dates and times, we have to consider complicating factors like...

-   Daylight Savings Time.
    -   One day a year is 23 hours; one day a year is 25 hours.
    -   Some places use it, some don't.
-   Leap years -- most years have 365 days, some have 366.
-   Time zones.

## `lubridate`

::::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   Convert a date-like variable ("May 8, 1995") to a date or date-time object.

-   Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a date-time object.

-   Convert between time zones.
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image shows the hex logo for the lubridate R package. The logo is a green hexagon with a stylized calendar in the center. The calendar has a small clock icon overlapping its bottom left corner, symbolizing time-related functions. The text 'lubridate' appears prominently below the calendar icon within the hexagon. Lubridate is commonly used in R for working with date and time data."

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/main/thumbs/lubridate.png?raw=true")
```
:::
:::::

::: callout-note
The `lubridate` package **installs** and **loads** with the `tidyverse`. 
:::

<!-- ## `date-time` Objects -->

<!-- There are multiple **data types** for dates and times. -->

<!-- -   A date: -->
<!--     -   `date` or `Date` -->
<!-- -   A date and a time (identifies a unique instant in time): -->
<!--     -   `dtm` -->
<!--     -   `POSIXlt` -- stores date-times as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 ("Unix Epoch") -->
<!--     -   `POSIXct` -- stores date-times as a list with elements for second, minute, hour, day, month, year, etc. -->

## Creating `date-time` Objects

::: {.midi}
From individual components:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

make_date(year = 1995, month = 05, day = 08)
```
:::

. . .

::: {.midi}
From a string:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy("August 29, 1991")
```
:::

. . .

::: {.midi}
With a time zone:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy("29-August-1991", 
    tz = "America/Denver")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

dmy_hms("29-August-1991 9:32:12", 
        tz = "America/Denver")
```
:::

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- #| code-line-numbers: false -->

<!-- as_datetime("91-08-29",  -->
<!--             format = "%y-%m-%d") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
<!-- #| code-line-numbers: false -->

<!-- parse_datetime("8/29/1991",  -->
<!--                format = "%m/%d/%Y") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Creating `date-time` Objects -->

<!-- ![](images/date_symbols.png){width="80%" fig-alt=""} -->

## Common Mistake with Dates

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as_datetime(2023-02-6)
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

my_date <- 2023-02-6
my_date
```
:::
:::

</br>

::: {.centered}
***What's wrong here?***
:::

<br>

. . .

Make sure you use quotes!

-   2,015 seconds $\approx$ 33.5 minutes

## Extracting `date-time` Components

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

bday <- ymd_hms("1989-01-14 12:03:12", 
                tz = "America/Denver")
bday
```

. . .

</br> 

::::: columns
::: column
::: {.midi}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

year(bday)
month(bday)
day(bday)
hour(bday)
```
:::
:::

::: column
::: {.midi}
::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

wday(bday)

wday(bday, 
     label = TRUE, 
     abbr = FALSE)
```
:::
:::

:::::

## Subtraction with `date-time` Objects

Doing subtraction gives you a `difftime` object. 

`difftime` objects do not always have the same units -- it depends on the scale of the objects you are working with.

## How old am I?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

today() - mdy(01141989)
```

. . .

</br> 

How long did it take me to type this slide?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

begin <- mdy_hms("10/13/2025 6:40:34")
finish <- mdy_hms("10/13/2025 6:43:11")

finish - begin
```

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Durations** will always give the time span in an **exact number of seconds**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.duration(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
            )
```

:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.fragment}
**Periods** will give the time span in more approximate, but **human readable times**.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

as.period(
  today() - mdy(01141989)
  )
```
:::
:::
:::

## Durations and Periods

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
We can also **add** time to `date-time` objects:

-   `days()`, `years()`, etc. will add a **period** of time.
-   `ddays()`, `dyears()`, etc. will add a **duration** of time.
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.fragment}
Because durations use the **exact** number of seconds to represent days and years, you might get unexpected results. 

</br> 

When is is my 99th birthday?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + years(99)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

mdy(01141989) + dyears(99)
```
:::
:::
:::

## Intervals of Time

::: {.midi}

Suppose American Airlines requires members to travel within 4 weeks before or
after their birthday to earn a "Birthday Bonus Flight."
:::

. . .

::: {.midi}
Well, we first need to make an interval of time around my birthday.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

bonus_flight_window <- interval(
  bday - weeks(4),
  bday + weeks(4)
  )
```
:::

. . .

</br>

::: {.midi}

Then I can check if today is within this interval. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

today() %within% bonus_flight_window
```
:::


## Time Zones...

...are complicated! 

</br> 

Specify time zones in the form:

-   {continent}/{city} -- "America/Denver", "Africa/Nairobi"
-   {ocean}/{city} -- "Pacific/Auckland"

. . .

What time zone does R think I'm in?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

Sys.timezone()
```

## Time Zones

::: {.midi}
You can change the time zone of a date in two ways:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- ymd_hms("2025-10-13 18:00:00", 
             tz = "Europe/Copenhagen")
```
:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="52%"}
`with_tz()`

::: {.small}
Keeps the instant in time the same, but modifies the representation based on the
new time zone

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  with_tz(tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")

x |> 
  with_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.fragment}
`force_tz()`

::: {.small}
Changes the instant in time by forcing a time zone change.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x |> 
  force_tz(tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")

x |> 
  force_tz(tzone = "Asia/Kolkata")
```
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Common Mistake with Dates

::: {.midi}
When you read data in or create a new date-time object, the default time zone (if not specified) is UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)*.  
:::

::: {.small}
*UTC is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)
:::

. . .

</br>

::: {.midi}
So, make sure you specify your desired time zone!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993")
tz(x)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false

x <- mdy("11/20/1993", 
         tz = "America/Los_Angeles")
tz(x)
```
