<!-- Feedback from Grade Expectation quiz: -->

<!-- - I am wondering if there is a specific number for the amount of assignments that constitutes all but a few for when phrasing like this is used in the grading criteria.Â¬ -->

<!-- - I'm confused by what counts as progression and pushing yourself, how is that measured. I think for me I would like a specific amount of challenges and maybe a growth over time of challenging oneself. -->

<!-- While this would be good, this is hard to measure and to show when arguing for our grades. (group collaboration) -->
