# What is R?

## 

**R** is a programming language designed originally for *statistical analyses*.

</br>

. . .

**R** was created by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** in 1993.

*(Their names are why it's called **R**, which is also a joke about the predecessor being called **S**.)*

. . .

</br>

**R** was formally released by the **R Core Group** in 1997.

<https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html>

This group of 20-ish volunteers are the *only* people who can change the **base** (built-in) functionality of **R**. 

## R is popular and growing!

## Strengths

**R**'s **strengths** are...

. . .

... handling data with lots of **different types** of variables.

. . .

... making nice and complex data **visualizations**.

. . .

**... having cutting-edge statistical methods available to users.**

# Weaknesses

**R**'s **weaknesses** are...

. . .

... performing non-analysis programming tasks, like website creation.

(*python*, *ruby*, ...)

. . .

... hyper-efficient numerical computation.

(*matlab*, *C*, ...)

. . .

... being a simple tool for all audiences

(*SPSS*, *STATA*, *JMP*, *Minitab*, ...)

# But wait!

# Packages

The heart and soul of **R** is **packages**.

These are "extra" sets of code that add **new functionality** to R when installed. 

. . .

</br> 

"Official" **R** packages live on the *Comprehensive R Archive Network*, or **CRAN**

But anyone can write and share new code in "package form" (more later)

# Open-Source

Importantly, **R** is *open-source*. There is no company that owns **R**, like there is for *SAS* or *Matlab*. (*Python* is also open-source!)

. . .

</br>

This means nobody can sell their **R** code!

-   but you can sell "helpers" like **RStudio**

-   and you can keep code **private** within an organization or company

. . .

**Packages are created by users like you and me!**

# Open Source

Being a good open-source citizen means...

... **sharing** your code publicly when possible.

(We'll learn about how to do this with *GitHub*!)

. . .

... **contributing** to public projects and packages, as you are able.

. . .

... creating your own **packages**, if you can.

. . .

... using **R** for **ethical and respectful** projects.

# Intro to RStudio

## What is RStudio?

. . .

**RStudio** is an IDE (*Integrated Developer Environment*).

This means it is an application that makes it easier for you to interact with **R**.

. . .

```

## History of RStudio

In 2011 RStudio was released by J.J. Allaire.

</br> 

. . .

In 2014, RStudio hired Hadley Wickham as Chief Data Scientist. 

*Recall: You cannot sell R code; packages created by RStudio's team are freely available.*

</br> 

. . .

In 2020, RStudio became a PBC (*Public Benefit Corp*), meaning they are legally obligated to support education and open-source development.

. . .

</br> 

In 2023, RStudio became Posit. They now employ over 50 full-time developers (for both R and Python).
