## The Beauty of R Projects

-   An **R Project** is basically a "flag" planted in a certain directory.

-   When you double click an **.Rproj** file, it:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Opens RStudio

2.  Sets the working directory to be wherever the .Rproj file lives.

3.  Links to GitHub, if set up (more on that later!)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/project_flag.jpg){width="70%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="A picture with two layers. The top image is a moutain peak with a red flag at the top of the peak. The bottom image is a translucent blue cube with an R in the middle (symbolizing an RProject) witht the file name 'stat331.RProj' displayed under the cube."}

## R Projects & Reproducibility

RStudio Projects are great for **reproducibility**!

You can send anyone your folder with your .Rproj file and they will be able
to run your code on their computer!

## Principles of Reproducibility

You can to send your project to someone else, and they can jump in and start
working right away.

This means:

1.  Files are organized and well-named.

2.  References to data and code work for everyone.

3.  Package dependency is clear.

4.  Code will run the same every time, even if data values change.

5.  Analysis process is well-explained and easy to read.

# Setting up an RStudio Project 

From an already existing directory (a folder you already have)

<!-- Create scribe video of making an R Project -->

![](../images/existing-directory-rproj.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A picture of the option you would select when making a new R Project for a folder that already exists on your computer. The image has a manilla folder in the background with a translucent blue cube with an R in the center in the font. The text next to the folder says 'Existing Directory' with a description saying 'Associate a project with an existing working directory'."}

# Setting up an RStudio Project 

Creating a new directory (a folder you **do not** already have)

<!-- Create scribe video of making an R Project -->

![](../images/new-directory-rproj.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A picture of the option you would select when making a new R Project for a folder that DOES NOT already exist on your computer. The image has a translucent blue cube with an R. The text next to the cube says 'New Directory' with a description saying 'Start a project in a brand new working directory'."}

## Good practice

-   Organize your folders carefully, and name them meaningfully:
    -   `/User/atheobold/Stat331/lab1/` rather than `Desktop/stuff/`
-   Use **R Projects** liberally - put one in the "main" folder for each project

## Bad practice

If you put something like this at the top of your .qmd file, I will set your
computer on fire:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: get-wd

setwd("/User/reginageorge/Desktop/R_Class/Lab_1/")
```

-   Setting working directory by hand = BAD!

-   That directory is specific to you!

-   Quarto will ignore this code when rendering!
