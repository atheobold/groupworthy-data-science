## The Beauty of R Projects

.pull-left\[ An **R Project** is basically a "flag" planted in a certain directory.

When you double click a **.Rproj** file, it does two things:

1.  Open RStudio

2.  Set the working directory to be wherever the .Rproj file lives.

3.  Link to GitHub, if setup (more on that later!)\]

# Good practice

-   Organize your folders carefully, and name them meaningfully:

    -   `/User/atheobold/Stat331/lab1/` rather than `Desktop/stuff/`

-   Use **R Projects** liberally - put one in the "main" folder for each project

    -   I have a project for every class I teach.
    -   I have a project for every data analysis I do.
    -   I **never** work in RStudio, except in a project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bad practice

If you put something like this at the top of your .Rmd file, I will set your computer on fire:

```{r setwd, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/User/reginageorge/Desktop/R_Class/Lab_1/")
```

-   Setting working directory by hand = BAD!

--

-   That directory is specific to you!
