## File Management

As boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important
skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends
just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools
used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible
analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important---such as
file management.

Evidently, there has been a bit of generational shift as computers have evolved:
the "file system" metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files
anymore. [This article](https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) 
is an interesting discussion of the problem: it makes the argument that with
modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper
instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet.

### File Systems 

Regardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is probably 
helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer **file system**
-- a way to organize data stored on a hard drive. Since data is always stored as
0's and 1's, it's important to have some way to figure out what type of data is
stored in a specific location, and how to interpret it.

### File Paths 

That's not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the
location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand
**file paths**.

When you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored
in a `.csv` file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file
structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a
single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).

For now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to
refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this
situation, your "base folder" is known as your **working directory** - the place
your program thinks of as home.


## Directories, Paths, and Projects {#directories-and-projects}

In `R`, there are two ways to set up your file path and file system organization:

1.  Set your working directory in `R` (do not recommend)
2.  Use RProjects (preferred!)

### Working Directories in `R`

To find where your working directory is in `R`, you can either look at the top
of your console or type `getwd()` into your console.

```{r}
#| out-width: "70%"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/working-directory-console.png")
```

```{r}
getwd()
```

Although it is not recommended, you can set your working directory in `R` with `setwd()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
setwd("/path/to/my/assignment/folder")
```

### R Projects

#### ðŸ“– [Required Reading: Workflow and Projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

Since there are often many files necessary for a project (e.g. data sources, 
images, etc.), `R` has a nice built in system for setting up your project
organization with R Projects. You can either create a new folder on your
computer containing an R Project (e.g., you have not yet created a folder for
this class) or you can add an R Project to an existing folder on your computer
(e.g., you have already created a folder for this class).

::: panel-tabset

#### Create with a new folder

To create a R Project, first open RStudio on your computer and click 
`File > New Project`, then:

```{r}
#| out-width: "70%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/create-new-rproj-step1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/create-new-rproj-step2.png")
```

Give your folder a name (it doesn't have to be my-stat331). However, it is good
practice for this file folder name to not contain spaces.

Then, browse on your computer for a location to save this folder to. For
example, mine is saved in my Documents. Make sure you know how to find this; it
should NOT be saved in your Downloads!

```{r}
#| out-width: "70%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/create-new-rproj-step3.png")
```

This new folder, `my-stat331` should now live in your Documents folder (or
wherever you save it to) and contain a `my-stat331.Rproj` file. This is your new
"home" base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path
it will begin to look for it here.

#### Add to an existing folder

To add a R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already
created a folder for this class), first open RStudio on your computer and click
`File > New Project`, then:

```{r}
#| out-width: "70%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/create-existing-rproj-step1.png")
```

Then, browse on your computer to select the existing folder you wish to add your
R Project to. For example, mine is saved in my Documents and called `my-stat331`.

```{r}
#| out-width: "70%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/week-1/create-existing-rproj-step2.png")
```

Your existing folder, `my-stat331` should now contain a `my-stat331.Rproj` file.
This is your new "home" base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with
a relative path it will begin to look for it here.

# Your folder cannot synch with anything online!

Your STAT 331 folder **cannot** be in a folder stored on OneDrive or iCloud!
Storing your folder in this location will cause your code to periodically not
run and I cannot help you fix it.

Take a screenshot of your class directory, showing:

1.  the location of your Stat 331 folder
2.  an R Project included in your Stat 331 folder 
2.  a Week 1 sub-folder

# Reproducible Documents

Over the last ten years, science has experienced a "reproducibility" crisis. 
Meaning, a substantial portion of scientific findings were unable to be
recreated because people didn't sufficiently document the processes they used.
As such, a foundational aspect of scientific research is using tools which allow
others to reproduce your findings.

Enter Quarto---a dynamic document that allows us to interweave R code and
written text in the **same** document. Gone are the days of copying and pasting
the results of your R code into a Word document---breaking the connection
between your analysis and your report. Quarto is here to save the day!

## Downloading Quarto

The software associated with Quarto is automatically downloaded with the newest
versions of RStudio. So, if you are using the most up to date version of RStudio
(as instructed in [Part 1 of this week's coursework](week-1-r-rstudio.qmd)), you
should already have Quarto installed on your computer. But, let's test it out.

To ensure you have Quarto installed, carry out the following process:

-   Open RStudio
-   Click on "File" (in the upper navigation bar)
-   Select "New File" (in the dropdown options)
-   Select "Quarto Document..." (in the dropdown option)

![](images/week-1/new-quarto-doc-file.png){width="50%" fig-alt="A screenshot of the dropdown options for creating a new Quarto document. The image shows the options under the 'File' menu (in the upper option bar), the 'New File' option in the 'File' menu has been selected, opneing a popout. In the popout options, the cursor is highlighting the 'Quarto Document' option."} </br>

If you have Quarto installed, you should be prompted with the following menu:

![](images/week-1/new-quarto-doc.png){width="50%" fig-alt="A screenshot of the menu that should appear when you carry out the process described above. The menu is a square box with a title reading 'New Quarto Document'. On the left hand side of the box, the user can select what type of Quarto product they wish to create (Document, Presentation, or Interactive). On the right hand side, the user can control various aspects of their document, including the title, the author, the type of rendered document (HTML, PDF, or Word). At the bottom there are options to 'Create an Empty Document' (a barebones document), to 'Create' a document (with the user specified options), or 'Cancel'."}

If, instead, you receive a message saying Quarto is not installed on your
computer, you need to download Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/download/>
