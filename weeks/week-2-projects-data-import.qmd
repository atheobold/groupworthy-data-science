## âœ…  Check-in 2.3: Loading Data

For this check-in you are asked to work through reading in different data sets. 
You are expected to create your own Quarto document to complete this activity. 

The folder `Age_Data` contains several data sets with the names and ages of five
individuals. The data sets are stored as different file types. 
[Download Ages_Data.zip here](Ages_Data.zip), make sure to unzip the folder,
save these in a reasonable place (e.g., `STAT331 > Week 2 > Checkins` or
`STAT331 > Checkins > Week 2`).

## Extracting zip folders

You will need to **extract** the contents of the `ages.zip` file, that means you
will need to uncompress the files from the folder for RStudio to know where to
get the data from.
:::

Once you have the data saved (and extracted) in your STAT 331 folder, preferably
in the Week 2 subfolder, use the `readr` and `readxl` packages to complete the
following exercises. 

1. Load the appropriate packages for reading in data.
2. Read in the data set *ages.csv*
3. Read in the data set *ages_tab.txt*
4. Read in the data set *ages_mystery.txt*
5. Read in the data set *ages.xlsx*
6. Find a way to use `read_csv()` to read *ages.csv* with the variable "Name" as a factor data type and "Age" as a character data type.

Once you've finished coding these exercises, head over to Canvas and fill in the
"gap" code I've provided. For reference, I would recommend you store the 
`Ages_Data` similar to how I have:

The STAT 331 folder lives in my documents and has two main folders--Week 1 and Week 2. The Week 2 folder is expanded to show that I have a subfolder named 'Check-ins' that lives inside the Week 2 folder. The expanded folders also show that inside the Check-ins folder (inside the Week 2 folder) there is an 'Agest_Data' folder, which contains four different datasets--ages_mystery.txt, ages_space.txt, ages.csv, and ages.xlsx."}
