This week is all about special data types in R. Similar to the tools you learned
last week for working with factors, this week you are going to learn about 
tools for working with dates. By the end of this week you should be
able to:

# Working with Dates {#sec-dates}

In order to fill in an important part of our toolbox, we need to learn how to

intuitive given we all work with schedules and calendars everyday. However,
there are little nuances that we will learn to make working with dates and times
easier.

you would use in R!*

**Q3** Which of the following is true about the `%within%` operator?
