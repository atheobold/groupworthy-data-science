The focus this week is on writing your own functions in R. While we've learned 
a lot of great tools in R, these tools have largely lived in the **tidyverse**
set of packages. This week, we're going to learn more about the functionality 
of "base R," which will likely come in handy when we are writing our own
functions. By the end of this coursework you should be able to:

+ use `[]` to extract elements from a vector
+ use `[]` and `$` to extract elements from a dataframe
+ explain the difference in behavior between a `tibble` and a `data.frame`
+ write one or more `if()` statements
+ write one or more `else if()` statement
+ write an `else()` statement
+ explain the difference between using `if()` + `else if()` and using `if_else()`
